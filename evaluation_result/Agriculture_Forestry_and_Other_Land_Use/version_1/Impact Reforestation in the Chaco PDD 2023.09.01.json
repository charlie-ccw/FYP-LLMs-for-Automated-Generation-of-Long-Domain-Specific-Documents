However, it lacks specific details that are present in the target text such as the business model of Investancia, the exact location (Estancia Santa Rosanna in Carmelo Peralta), and the scale of the project (e.g., 2,500 hectares per year scaling to 7,500 hectares per year). Additionally, it does not mention the nursery establishment, genetic strain assessments, or land leasing discussions.
