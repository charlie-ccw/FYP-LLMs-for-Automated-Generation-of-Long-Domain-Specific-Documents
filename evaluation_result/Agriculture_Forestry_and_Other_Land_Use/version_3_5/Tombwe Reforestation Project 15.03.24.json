However, the generated text introduces several additional details and terminologies not present in the target text, such as GIS and CTO-Survey, which may not align perfectly with the original content. Additionally, while the generated text follows a clear structure, it deviates slightly from the target text's more narrative style by adopting a more segmented and bullet-point format.
