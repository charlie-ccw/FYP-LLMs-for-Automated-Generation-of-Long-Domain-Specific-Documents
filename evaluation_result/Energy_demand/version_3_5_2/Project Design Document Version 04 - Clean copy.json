Furthermore, the generated text does not provide the annual average and total reductions and removals explicitly, nor does it mention the organizations involved, such as Vikram Stoves and GKEMPL.

The generated text also introduces some new points that are not found in the target text, such as promoting clean cooking practices and mitigating health risks, which may not be relevant to the original context.
