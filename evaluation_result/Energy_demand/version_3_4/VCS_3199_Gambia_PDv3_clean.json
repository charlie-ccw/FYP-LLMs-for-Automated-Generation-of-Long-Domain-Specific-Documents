However, the generated text introduces additional details not present in the target text, such as specific coordinates, local manufacturing, and capacity-building, which, while enriching, deviate from the template requirement of a summary. The generated text also slightly rephrases and expands upon the target text, which could be seen as both a strength and a weakness depending on the strictness of adherence to the template.
