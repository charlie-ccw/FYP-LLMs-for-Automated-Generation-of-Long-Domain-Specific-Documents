Thirdly, the location specified in the generated text (Haute Matsiatra) does not match the broader geographical boundary of 'Country of Madagascar' mentioned in the target text. Additionally, the generated text provides a different estimate for annual GHG reductions (15,000 metric tons) compared to the target text's 37,722 tCO2e/annum.
