The CPA, designated as the 3rd CPA under the PoA, is undergoing Gap Validation under the VCS mechanism in compliance with the VCS Standard V4.2. The registered CDM PoA, titled Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project by KCM, holds the UNFCCC reference number 10477 and is managed by Korea Carbon Management Ltd. (KCM). The primary objective of this CPA is the distribution of 28,000 energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) in households within Yen Lap, Tam Nong, Thanh Son, Thanh Thuy, and Tan Son districts in Phu Tho Province, Vietnam. The ICS deployment aims to reduce firewood consumption, thereby mitigating climate change impact sustainably. The project targets greenhouse gas reduction, forest conservation, and enhanced health conditions for ICS users. The 4G ICS, a single pot improved cookstove made of steel, is locally produced and designed to optimize airflow and heat distribution, achieving a thermal efficiency of 30.00% over its 5-year lifespan. The initiative caters to rural communities without prior ICS access, offering free distribution of stoves within the specified geographical boundaries. Korea Carbon Management (KCM) has fully funded the project implementation. The project's baseline scenario mirrors the conventional practice of using firewood in open fires for cooking energy needs. The estimated GHG emission reductions for the chosen crediting period are 46,339 tCO2e/annum and 463,390 tCO2e in total."

The primary aim is to introduce energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass in Viet Nam. The core technology utilized is the energy-efficient improved cooking stoves (ICS) to reduce fuelwood consumption and promote technological self-reliance. These stoves are designed to enhance energy efficiency and fuel savings, thereby contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The baseline and monitoring methodology utilized is \"Energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass, version-11.0\". It is expected that the project will result in GHG emission reductions or removals of approximately 43,093 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. The estimated volume of emission reduction falls below 300,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, highlighting the significant impact of the project in mitigating climate change. The primary manufacturing technology involved in the project is the production of 4G cookstoves constructed from steel. These cookstoves are specifically designed to enhance energy efficiency and promote fuel savings, aligning with the project's sustainability goals. As per the manufacturer's specifications, the 4G ICS has a projected lifespan of at least 5 years, ensuring long-term effectiveness and efficiency in reducing fuel consumption and GHG emissions. The project has introduced improved energy efficiency measures by incorporating locally manufactured technology. An adjustment factor of 0.95 has been applied to account for leakage. The estimated annual average GHG emission reductions for the crediting period amount to 43,093 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum. The project offers services such as the provision of improved cookstoves with enhanced energy efficiency, reducing reliance on firewood for cooking purposes. Additionally, the project includes capacity development initiatives and technical training programs to enhance the knowledge and skills of individuals involved in the project. In the baseline scenario, the same types and levels of services would have been provided by using traditional three-stone open fires to generate thermal energy for cooking, highlighting the significant improvement brought about by the project's implementation. Before the project's initiation, thermal energy for cooking was generated using three-stone open fires. The transition to energy-efficient improved cooking stoves marks a substantial advancement in reducing fuel consumption and GHG emissions within the project boundary. By implementing these energy-efficient measures, the project aims to drive sustainable development, reduce environmental impact, and contribute to global efforts in combating climate change."

It outlines methodologies for measuring, recording, storing, aggregating, collating, and reporting data, along with organizational structure, responsibilities, personnel competencies, internal auditing, QA/QC procedures, handling non-conformances, and sampling approaches.\n\n## Methods for Measuring, Recording, Storing, and Reporting\nMethods for data measurement, recording, storage, aggregation, collation, and reporting are specified in section 3.20.5 of the VCS Standard V4.3. These methods ensure accuracy through precise data collection techniques and equipment calibration procedures.\n\n## Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities\nDefining the organizational structure is crucial for effective allocation of responsibilities and competencies. Personnel are accountable for data availability, monitoring adherence to the plan, and consulting the VCS Standard for guidance.\n\n## Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\nRobust internal auditing and QA/QC procedures maintain monitoring process integrity, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and data accuracy.\n\n## Handling Non-Conformances\nProcedures from the VCS Standard V4.3 should be followed for addressing non-conformances swiftly and appropriately.\n\n## Sampling Approaches and QA/QC Procedures\nSampling approaches must consider precision levels, sample sizes, locations, stratification, measurement frequency, and QA/QC procedures to ensure data reliability.\n\n## GHG Data Collection and Management System\nVisual line diagrams can enhance understanding of the GHG data collection and management system, illustrating data flow, monitoring points, and reporting mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-defined Monitoring Plan is crucial for accurate data collection, analysis, and compliance."
