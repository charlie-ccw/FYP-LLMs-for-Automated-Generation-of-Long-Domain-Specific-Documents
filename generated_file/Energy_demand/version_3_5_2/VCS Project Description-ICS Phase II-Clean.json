The chosen method for demonstrating additionality entails distributing stoves at zero cost to end-users, with revenue solely generated from the sale of GHG credits. Barrier analysis focuses on estimating the efficiency of the improved cookstoves ex-ante, considering a conservative approach based on manufacturer specifications and potential efficiency losses per batch. The methodology aligns with VCS methodology requirements and relevant parameters specified in the latest version of meth AMS II.G. Applicability criteria numbers 8 and 9 from Section 2.2 of AMS II.G, version 11.1, are applied to ensure conformity with the positive list.
