Baseline emissions may exhibit negative values when carbon stock increases surpass baseline emissions, reflecting carbon sinks. The procedure for quantifying baseline emissions involves monitoring specific parameters to determine the carbon dynamics within the project scope.\n\n### Monitoring Parameters\nBaseline emissions are quantified based on monitored parameters such as the number of improved cookstoves (ICS) and the average number of persons per household. These parameters play a pivotal role in estimating the baseline emissions and subsequent carbon stock changes.\n\n### Carbon Stock Changes Estimation\nTo gauge carbon stock changes accurately, considerations are made for potential leakages, particularly concerning the utilization of non-renewable woody biomass saved under the project activity. Sampling procedures outlined in the guideline for sampling and surveys for CDM project activities are adhered to in determining the annual quantity of wood consumed in the absence of the project activity.\n\n### Separation of Reductions and Removals\nThe applied methodology entails separate quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals. This segregation allows for a more detailed analysis of the carbon dynamics within the project framework.\n\n### Equations for Quantification\nThe quantification process involves utilizing various equations to compute baseline emissions and carbon stock changes. Key equations include factors such as wood fuel emissions, non-CO2 emission factors, the number of improved cookstoves, discount factors for leakage, and biomass saved due to the implementation of improved cookstoves.\n\n### Methodological Choices and Justifications\nMethodological choices are critical in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of baseline emission quantification. Emission factors and default values are selected meticulously, aligning with approved methodologies such as VMR0006, v1.1. Justifications for these choices are provided to offer transparency and rationale behind the selection process.\n\n### Reproducibility of Calculations\nTo enhance transparency and reproducibility, all calculations are documented in an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. Equations outlined in the methodology enable readers to reproduce the calculations effectively, fostering a clear understanding of the quantification process.\n\nBy following the outlined procedure, utilizing relevant equations, and making informed methodological choices, the quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes can be conducted rigorously and comprehensively."

These equations play a pivotal role in determining the project's net emission reductions.\n\n### Baseline Emissions Distribution Record\n\nAccurate calculation of baseline emissions necessitates the maintenance of a distribution record reflecting emissions linked to project undertakings. This record acts as a benchmark for evaluating the project's emission impact.\n\n### Carbon Stock Change Quantification\n\nQuantifying carbon stock changes involves multiple factors, including decreased non-renewable wood fuel consumption and baseline establishment for other Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Leakage adjustments are also incorporated to ensure precise calculations.\n\n### Distinction Between Reductions and Removals\n\nTo provide clarity, reductions and removals must be distinctly specified, enabling an accurate determination of the project's net emission reductions. This differentiation is crucial for transparent reporting.\n\n### Key Equations for Computation\n\nThe methodology includes essential equations for computing net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals. Additionally, specific equations for estimating biomass consumption in the absence of project activities support accurate calculations.\n\n### Rationale and Justification of Methodological Decisions\n\nMethodological decisions, such as emission factor selection and default value usage, must be elucidated and justified within the quantification process.

It encompasses methodologies for data measurement, recording, storage, aggregation, collation, reporting, calibration of monitoring equipment, organizational structure, responsibilities, personnel competencies, internal auditing, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), handling of non-conformances, and sampling strategies.\n\n### Methods for Data Measurement and Recording\n- **Measurement:** Parameters are ascertained through surveys, monitoring equipment, and QA/QC protocols.\n- **Recording:** Data is documented based on surveys, monitoring equipment, and mean values.\n- **Storage:** Data is stored considering monitoring intervals and manufacturer guidelines.\n- **Aggregation:** Summarized data is reported to the compliance manager and subjected to technical reviews.\n- **Collation:** Data is verified for completeness, consistency, and accuracy before being summarized in reports.\n- **Reporting:** Encompasses data validation, data summarization, and application of QA/QC procedures.\n\n### Calibration of Monitoring Equipment\n- Calibration aims for a 95/10 confidence/margin of error and determines sample sizes using a sampling standard.\n- Monitoring is conducted at least once every two years.\n\n### Organizational Structure and Responsibilities\n- **Structure:** Adherence to project design, technical staff training, and record-keeping systems.\n- **Responsibilities:** Compliance with monitoring systems, management of distribution processes, and collection of compliance data.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\n- Data is scrutinized for accuracy, summarized in reports, and subjected to technical reviews.\n\n### Handling Non-Conformances\n- Procedures involve data verification, summarization in reports, and technical reviews.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\n- **Approaches:** Representative sampling based on the project Sampling Plan.\n- **Precision Levels:** Targeting 95/10 confidence/precision.\n- **Sample Sizes:** Determined to achieve confidence/precision levels.\n- **Sample Sites:** Identified as Primary Sampling Units.\n- **Stratification:** Utilizing stratified sampling.\n- **Frequency:** At least once every two years.\n- **QA/QC:** Ensuring 95/10 confidence/margin of error and representative sampling.\n\n### GHG Data Collection System\n- Line diagrams will be included to display the GHG data collection and management system.\n\nThis comprehensive monitoring plan ensures effective data collection, analysis, and reporting while maintaining quality assurance and compliance with monitoring standards."
