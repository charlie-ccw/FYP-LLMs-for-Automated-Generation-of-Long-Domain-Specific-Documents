This step leads to the identification of the target population and the confirmation that they would persist in using non-renewable firewood without the project activity.\n\n### Key Assumptions\nThe key assumption underlying the baseline scenario identification is that in the absence of the project activity, the target population would continue utilizing non-renewable firewood or fossil fuel to meet their energy needs.\n\n### Rationale Behind Key Assumptions\nThe rationale for the key assumptions is that without the project activity, the target population would continue to depend on non-renewable firewood to meet their energy needs.\n\n### Methodological Choices\nThe baseline scenario was determined based on the assumption that the target population would maintain the use of non-renewable firewood for meeting energy needs in the absence of the project activity.\n\n### References\nAs per the para-6 of the approved methodology VMR0006 version 1.1, the baseline scenario is the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel (firewood/charcoal) or fossil fuel by the target population to meet similar thermal energy needs as provided by project cookstoves in the absence of project activity."

The following sections provide a comprehensive overview of the additionality methods employed in accordance with the applied methodology and relevant tools.\n\n### Regulatory Surplus\nThe project does not fall within an Annex 1 country, and the distribution of energy-efficient cookstoves is not mandated by any law, statute, or regulatory framework. Moreover, in the case of a Non-Annex 1 country, the laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks that could potentially mandate project activities are not systematically enforced. This absence of regulatory enforcement serves as evidence of regulatory surplus, indicating that the project activities go beyond mandatory requirements.\n\n### Additionality Methods\n1. **Method Selection:** The chosen methodology to demonstrate additionality is the activity method. This method involves showcasing the project's adherence to standardized baselines and generating revenue independent of GHG credit sales.\n\n2. **Steps and Outcomes:** Each step in the applied methodology is meticulously followed to ensure accurate documentation of outcomes. The project quantifies baseline emissions by measuring net emission reductions achieved, highlighting the project's additional environmental benefits.\n\n3. **Relevant Barriers:** The project identifies regulatory surplus and unique product and end-user location criteria as key barriers to additionality. These barriers are substantiated by updated standardized baseline procedures, ensuring the credibility of the project's unique contributions.\n\n4. **Performance Benchmark:** The project demonstrates that performance levels meet or exceed the established performance benchmark metric, underscoring the project's capability to achieve environmental objectives effectively.\n\n5. **Reproducibility:** To facilitate transparency and reproducibility, all relevant data and parameters utilized in the additionality analysis are provided with clear sources, enabling stakeholders to replicate the analysis and validate the results independently.\n\nIn conclusion, the project's additionality is rigorously assessed and demonstrated through the application of the activity method, adherence to regulatory surplus considerations, and meticulous documentation of outcomes and barriers.

Equations 1 and 2 are utilized to compute net greenhouse gas emissions, considering the non-renewable woody biomass's net calorific value.\n\n### Calculation of Baseline Emissions with Carbon Stock Increases\n\nEven if carbon stock increases surpass baseline emissions, the methodology continues to emphasize quantifying the net emission reductions achieved by the project. Equations 1 and 2 are applied to calculate net greenhouse gas emission reductions in such instances.\n\n### Distinguishing Reductions and Removals\n\nWhile the methodology specifies reductions by quantifying net emission reductions, it does not explicitly differentiate removals from reductions during the quantification process.\n\n### Key Equations for Quantification\n\nEquation-4 and Equation-2 are pivotal in quantifying baseline emissions and carbon stock changes. These equations play a significant role in determining net greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating the project's impact on carbon stocks.\n\n### Rationale and Justification of Methodological Decisions\n\nThe methodology's choice to not separately consider baseline emissions but to focus on net emission reductions is rooted in the comprehensive assessment of the project's impact. All calculations, including those based on relevant equations, must be recorded in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for result reproducibility.\n\nBy adhering to the methodology and utilizing the specified equations, an accurate quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes can be achieved, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the project's environmental footprint."

This comprehensive approach ensures an accurate representation of the overall impact on GHG emissions.\n\n### Distinguishing Reductions and Removals\n\nReductions and removals are distinctly identified using Equation-1 and Equation-2 from the methodology outlined in the VCS Project Description-ICS Phase I-Clean document. This differentiation facilitates a clear delineation between emission reduction and GHG removal from the atmosphere.\n\n### Essential Equations for Quantifying Project Emissions and Carbon Stock Changes\n\nEquations 1 and 2 of the methodology are pivotal in quantifying project emissions and carbon stock changes. Understanding these equations is fundamental in calculating net GHG emissions and comprehending the project's overall emission impact.\n\n### Methodological Decisions and Rationale\n\nDecisions regarding methodology, including the selection of emission factors and default values, significantly influence the quantification process. Justifying the use of default values for factors like baseline cookstove efficiency, non-CO2 emission factors for wood fuel use, and CO2 emission factors for wood fuel use in the baseline scenario is crucial.
