Location of the Project:\nThe project will be executed in Zambia, with specific coordinates provided as 13\u00b008'02.0\"S latitude and 27\u00b050'57.6\"E longitude.\n\n### 3. GHG Emission Reductions/Carbon Dioxide Removals:\nThroughout the 10-year crediting period, the project aims to achieve substantial GHG emission reductions. Initial estimates suggest a progressive reduction from 849,058 tCO2e in Year 1 to 2,830,683 tCO2e in Year 4, contributing significantly to combating climate change and promoting sustainable energy sources.\n\n### 4. Scenario Prior to Project Implementation:\nPrior to the project initiation, the community heavily relied on non-renewable wood fuel for their energy needs, resulting in increased emissions and environmental degradation. The project's intervention seeks to address this unsustainable practice.\n\n### 5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals:\nEach ICS instance is anticipated to achieve an average annual GHG emission reduction of 6.79 t CO2e. Collectively, the group project activity is projected to reduce emissions by a total of 1,713,078 t CO2e over the crediting period.\n\nThis detailed overview highlights the project's objectives, anticipated environmental impact, and its pivotal role in fostering sustainable practices and mitigating GHG emissions."

The selected stoves meet the specified high-power thermal efficiency of at least 25% as per the manufacturer's guidelines. These stoves utilize woody biomass, are either single pot or multi-pot, and have an efficiency rating of 34.5%.\n\nBoth 'Projects' and 'Large Projects' can adopt this methodology. The estimated average annual emission reductions exceed 300,000 tonnes CO2e, meeting the 'Large Projects' criteria.\n\nNon-renewable biomass usage in the project region since December 31, 1989, is substantiated through surveys, published literature, official reports, or statistics.\n\nFor biomass residues processed as fuel, it must be demonstrated that only renewable biomass is used, fuel consumption is monitored, and energy use for processing is equivalent to upstream emissions from displaced fossil fuels.\n\nThe project design outlines a clear distribution method for project devices to prevent double counting of emission reductions. Each ICS is uniquely identified by customer name, geographical location, and a serial number, ensuring no duplication within the project. Additionally, cross-checks with relevant carbon schemes are conducted to avoid overlap.\n\nStove manufacturers, wholesale providers, and end users commit to the project's sole ownership of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) through signed undertakings.\n\nEvidence of non-renewable biomass use since 1989 is supported by FAO data showing a decline in forest areas and a high fraction of non-renewable biomass in total biomass.\n\n## Methodology ID: VM0007\n\n### Applicability Condition: The stoves that are not in use will be excluded from emissions reductions calculations and will not be counted towards the total number of ICS in operation during the monitoring period.\n\n#### Justification of Compliance:\nThe project ensures compliance with this applicability condition by excluding stoves that are not in use from the emissions reductions calculations. Only stoves that are actively in operation are considered for the total number of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) during the monitoring period. This exclusion is essential to accurately measure the impact of the project and ensure that emission reductions are calculated based on operational stoves, reflecting the true environmental benefits achieved."

This approach ensures accurate assessment of the impact of leakage on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Calculation Method\nThe quantification of leakage emissions involves using a default value of 0.95, which is integral to precise emissions calculations. The equation for calculating leakage emissions is: \n\nLeakage Emissions = Total Emissions x 0.95\n\n### Application of Default Value\nTo calculate leakage emissions, it is essential to apply the default value of 0.95 consistently. By multiplying the total emissions by 0.95, stakeholders can obtain the precise quantity of emissions attributable to leakage.\n\n### Methodological Consistency\nAdhering to the default value of 0.95 for leakage ensures methodological consistency and standardization in emissions quantification. This choice aligns with established methodologies and facilitates accurate assessment of leakage impacts.\n\n### Emission Factor Significance\nThe emission factor of 0.95 for leakage is significant in estimating the influence of leakage on greenhouse gas emissions. This factor serves as a key parameter in determining the emissions associated specifically with leakage.\n\n### Emission Reduction Analysis\nEmission reductions are separately quantified to determine the net greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved over the project duration. Detailed calculations for emission reductions are based on the EFwf,non CO2 data parameter from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\nBy following this methodology and utilizing the specified equations, stakeholders can effectively quantify leakage emissions and evaluate their impact on greenhouse gas emissions within the project context."
