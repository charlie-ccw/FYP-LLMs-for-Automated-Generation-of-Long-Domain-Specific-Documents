The processes for measuring, documenting, archiving, and aggregating are expounded in sections B.7.1 and B.7.3 of the PDD, while organizing is stipulated in section B.7.1. The reporting procedures are delineated in sections B.7.3 and B.7.1 of the PDD. Calibration protocols for monitoring apparatus are explicitly outlined in sections B.7.3 and B.7.1 of the PDD to ensure the precision and dependability of data.\n\n### Organizational Structure and Personnel\nThe organizational setup for monitoring undertakings is not expressly defined. Personnel duties encompass validation, monitoring, and analysis of data and parameters as per the Monitoring Plan. The competencies necessary for personnel engaged in monitoring operations are critical for precise data collection and analysis.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC\nThe internal auditing and QA/QC processes entail the application of methodologies on a small scale under Type II, with a cumulative energy conservation of less than 20 GWh/annum or 60 GWhth/annum. These processes guarantee the correctness and reliability of monitored data and parameters.\n\n### Handling Non-Conformances\nThe guidelines for addressing non-compliances with the validated monitoring plan are expounded in section B.7.3 of the PDD. Timely and efficient resolution of non-conformances is imperative to uphold the integrity of the monitoring regime.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\nSampling methodologies involve the selection of households from the Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) categories based on vulnerability assessments across 13 parameters. The sampling approach considers target precision levels, sample sizes, site selections, stratification, measurement frequency, and QA/QC protocols to ensure the collection of representative and accurate data.\n\n### GHG Data Collection and Management System\nThe GHG data collection and management system are illustrated through line diagrams, offering a visual depiction of the monitoring process and data flow.\n\nThis comprehensive monitoring plan guarantees the methodical and precise collection, analysis, and disclosure of monitored data and parameters, aligning with the stipulations in Section 5.2."
