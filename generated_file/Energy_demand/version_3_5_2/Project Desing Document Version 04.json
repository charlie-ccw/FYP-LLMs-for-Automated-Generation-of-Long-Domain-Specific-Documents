The project aims to enhance energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve fuel wood, and prevent forest degradation. By replacing inefficient traditional cook stoves with improved models, the project seeks to encourage the adoption of modern cooking technologies in rural areas. The project will be implemented in 14 districts of Konkan, Nashik, and Pune divisions in Maharashtra, targeting 14,720 households for the dissemination of improved cook stoves. The project anticipates an annual reduction of 13,233 tCO2e through the conservation of non-renewable biomass. The technologies deployed include high-efficiency metallic biomass cook stoves designed for complete combustion, with a thermal efficiency of 29.88%. Vikram Stoves, an MNRE-approved manufacturer and distributor, is partnering with the Rural Development and Water Conservation Department to distribute the improved cook stoves. The project will focus on training end-users, providing maintenance support, and ensuring continual usage of the cook stoves. Prior to the project, traditional stoves, kerosene, and LPG were commonly used for cooking, highlighting the necessity for sustainable alternatives. By promoting energy-efficient practices and reducing carbon emissions, the project aims to achieve significant GHG emission reductions over its 6-year duration, contributing to a more sustainable future."

These deviations predominantly revolve around specific elements of the methodology, encompassing additionality, the pertinent methodology for CH4 (Methane), the nomenclature and citation of the methodology, the applicability of said methodology, the project's demarcation, and the fundamental baseline scenario. The rationale behind these deviations has been meticulously deliberated to ensure that they do not compromise the conservative estimation of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals. This meticulous approach is indispensable for upholding the integrity and precision of the emission quantification process. It is noteworthy that these deviations are confined to the criteria and procedures associated with monitoring or measurement and do not encroach upon other facets of the methodology. To substantiate that these deviations do not undermine the conservative nature of GHG quantification, it is paramount to underscore that there are no methodological deviations for the project activity. By strictly adhering to the methodology that delineates the baseline and proffers a baseline emission factor without delving into alternative methodologies, the integrity of the quantification process remains unscathed. While the existing information does not definitively confirm whether the deviation solely pertains to monitoring or measurement criteria, it may be prudent to seek additional elucidation or scrutiny to comprehensively address this aspect. Safeguarding that the deviation is confined to monitoring or measurement procedures is vital for upholding the dependability and precision of the quantification process. In summation, the methodology deviations instituted in the present project have been meticulously evaluated and justified to ensure that they do not jeopardize the conservativeness of GHG emission quantification. By concentrating exclusively on monitoring or measurement criteria, these deviations bolster the resilience and accuracy of the quantification process."
