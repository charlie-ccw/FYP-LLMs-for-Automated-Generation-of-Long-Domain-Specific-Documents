Conduct field visits to ensure project stoves are operational and in use.\n\n### Organizational Structure, Responsibilities, and Competencies\n- **Organizational Structure**: Design monitoring systems, train local resources, conduct regular monitoring, and hold review meetings for improvement.\n- **Responsibilities**: Manage data collection, record emission reductions, update reports, manage household data, and prevent conflicts of interest.\n- **Competencies**: Ensure personnel are skilled in data collection, archiving, equipment calibration, and household data management.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\n- **Internal Auditing**: Verify survey information, review data transfers, audit emission reduction estimates, and training records.\n- **QA/QC**: Cross-verify survey data, review data transfers, check stove usage, and document quality control strategies.\n\n### Handling Non-Conformances\nIdentify discrepancies in internal audits, document and correct promptly, and address non-sampling errors for data integrity.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\n- **Approaches**: Utilize simple random sampling and oversampling.\n- **Precision Levels**: Determine minimum sample sizes based on target populations.\n- **Sample Sizes**: Vary based on target population size.\n- **Site Locations**: Choose samples within India's geographical boundary using a simple random sampling technique.\n- **Stratification**: Employ stratified random sampling.\n- **Frequency of Measurement**: Conduct measurements at least once every two years.\n- **QA/QC in Sampling**: Draw additional samples, collect data from specific stoves, and address non-sampling errors.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe monitoring plan ensures effective collection, management, and analysis of data and parameters to support emission reduction initiatives. Following the outlined procedures and approaches will contribute to the success and credibility of the project."
