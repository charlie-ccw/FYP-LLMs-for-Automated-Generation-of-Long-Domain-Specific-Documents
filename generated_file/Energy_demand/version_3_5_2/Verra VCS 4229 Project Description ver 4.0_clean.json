        "generation": "The Grouped Project focuses on disseminating energy-efficient improved cookstoves (ICS) to replace traditional cookstoves in Indian households and communities. Traditional cooking methods contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and indoor air pollution. The project aims to distribute woody biomass ICS to improve fuel combustion and reduce indoor air pollution. By reducing fuel consumption and emissions, the project seeks to access carbon finance to promote clean cookstove adoption. The expected distribution plan includes installing 1,000,000 ICS over four years. Without this project, beneficiaries would continue using inefficient stoves, perpetuating environmental and health degradation."
