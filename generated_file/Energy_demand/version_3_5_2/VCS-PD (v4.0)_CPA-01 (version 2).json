This CPA, designated as the 1st CPA under the PoA, is undergoing Gap Validation under the VCS mechanism as per the VCS Standard V4.3. The registered CDM PoA is titled 'Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project by KCM' with the UNFCCC reference number 10477, managed by Korea Carbon Management Ltd. (KCM). The primary objective of this CPA is to install energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) in households using wood as cooking fuel in specific districts of Hoa Binh Province, Viet Nam. A total of 30,000 ICSs will be distributed under this project, leading to reduced firewood consumption and sustainable climate change mitigation. The project aims at greenhouse gas reduction, forest conservation, and improved health conditions for ICS users through enhanced indoor air quality. The 3G improved cookstove, a single pot steel stove produced in the host country, is the focus of this project. Its design optimizes airflow and pressure, resulting in improved thermal efficiency and a projected lifespan of 5 years. The project targets rural households without prior access to ICS and operates in the districts of Tan Lac, Luong Son, Lac Son, and Kim Boi within Hoa Binh Province, Viet Nam. ICSs are provided free of charge to users, with full financing by Korea Carbon Management (KCM). The project's baseline scenario mirrors the common practice of using firewood in open fires for cooking energy, with estimated annual and total GHG emission reductions of 44,888 tCO2e/annum and 448,880 tCO2e, respectively."

The primary objective is to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by promoting the adoption of cleaner cooking technologies.\n\nCommencing on the designated start date, the project activities aim to promptly reduce or eliminate GHG emissions through the production and distribution of these energy-efficient cook stoves to targeted beneficiaries.\n\nThe manufacturing process involves utilizing clay and metal materials to create the Soarehitra stoves, with skilled artisans ensuring top-notch quality. The estimated lifespan of the Improved Cookstoves (ICS) produced within this initiative is 5.5 years, guaranteeing durability and sustained performance.\n\nBy providing energy-efficient cook stoves to the community, the project offers a sustainable solution for cooking needs. These stoves not only reduce environmental impact by conserving wood resources but also enhance social well-being by easing the burden of firewood collection. The project aims to deliver equivalent cooking services to traditional methods but with reduced emissions.\n\nThe distribution of improved cook stoves from external sources to the project area aligns with the goal of curbing GHG emissions and fostering sustainable cooking practices. The project adheres to local and national regulations concerning environmental and social impacts.\n\nIn the baseline scenario, traditional three-stone open fires would have been used to meet the cooking energy demand, resulting in higher emissions and strain on wood resources. The project's introduction of energy-efficient stoves offers a cleaner alternative to fulfill the same cooking energy demand, thereby decreasing GHG emissions and promoting sustainability.\n\nBefore project implementation, the community relied on traditional open fires for cooking, leading to elevated emissions and environmental harm. Transitioning to energy-efficient cook stoves signifies a substantial move towards sustainable cooking practices and reduced environmental impact.

These methodologies encompass the entire data life cycle from collection to reporting, guaranteeing data integrity and precision. Moreover, the protocols for calibrating monitoring apparatus, as delineated in the VCS Standard V4, are strictly followed to uphold measurement accuracy.\n\n## Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities\nThe organizational framework for monitoring activities is clearly outlined within the project's structure. The individuals entrusted with executing monitoring tasks possess the requisite skills and knowledge. The project has fostered local job opportunities and business growth by involving local stakeholders in the monitoring activities.\n\n## Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\nThe specific protocols for internal auditing and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) are indispensable for upholding the dependability of monitored data. These measures ensure that data collection and analysis adhere to established protocols and standards. Any deviations from the validated monitoring plan are rectified through systematic procedures as outlined in the VCS Standard V4.\n\n## Handling Non-Conformances\nProcedures for addressing non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan are in place to promptly rectify discrepancies or deviations. By adhering to the guidelines stipulated in the VCS Standard V4, the project upholds transparency and integrity in monitoring practices.\n\n## Sampling Approaches\nThe project's activities involve disseminating energy-efficient cook stoves with a focus on enhancing efficiency in thermal applications. While explicit details on sampling approaches are not provided, the project considers baseline emissions, project emissions, and potential leakage in the monitoring process. Sampling strategies, target precision levels, sample sizes, site locations, stratification, measurement frequency, and QA/QC procedures are crucial elements contributing to the overall robustness of the monitoring plan.\n\n## GHG Data Collection and Management System\nThe GHG data collection and management system are structured to ensure the precise measurement, documentation, and reporting of GHG emissions and pertinent parameters. Visual aids such as line diagrams may be employed to elucidate the data flow and management processes within the monitoring system, enhancing stakeholder comprehension of the project.\n\nFor detailed procedures and methodologies, refer to Section 3.19.5 of the VCS Standard V4. The monitoring plan stands as a pivotal element in the successful execution and assessment of the project's environmental performance."
