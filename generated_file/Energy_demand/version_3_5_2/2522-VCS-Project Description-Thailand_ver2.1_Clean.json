These sources were identified as significant contributors to CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.\n\n### Ensuring Quantification Accuracy\n\nBy upholding the methodology without deviations, the conservative approach to quantifying GHG emission reductions was guaranteed. The baseline emissions provided a dependable benchmark for evaluating the project's efficacy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Emphasis on Monitoring and Measurement Standards\n\nIt is crucial to highlight that any deviations previously employed were limited to monitoring or measurement criteria and procedures.

It encompasses the computation of net emission reductions, evaluation of carbon stock modifications, and the rationale behind methodological decisions.\n\n### Project Emissions Quantification\nThe quantification of project emissions entails the determination of net emission reductions accomplished by the project, without distinct consideration of baseline or project emissions. This assessment is based on the dissemination of 250,000 Kuniokoa (Ecoa Wood) and 250,000 'Local-ICSA' stoves produced locally. Each stove is monitored through a unique reference number in the tracking database to oversee the total stove count.\n\n### Carbon Stock Alterations Calculation\nCarbon stock changes are assessed by quantifying emission reductions derived from the non-renewable biomass conserved by the Improved Cookstove (ICS) implemented in the project activity.\n\n### Management of Excess Carbon Stock Increases\nIn instances where carbon stock increments exceed project emissions, the net GHG emission reductions or removals are computed by contrasting the anticipated baseline emissions or removals with the projected emissions or removals.\n\n### Determination of Reductions and Removals\nThe methodology does not delineate reductions and removals independently. Instead, it accentuates the quantification of net emission reductions achieved by the project without segregating baseline emissions from project emissions.\n\n### Formulas and Methodological Decisions\nThe methodology incorporates the CO2 emission factor for wood fuel from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, fixed at 112 tCO2/TJ. The computations involve variables such as the proportion of woody biomass preserved, the net calorific value of biomass, CO2 emission factor, and efficiency metrics across various years.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis document furnishes an elaborate overview of the project emissions quantification process and carbon stock alterations.

This document offers a comprehensive outline of the methodologies, organizational framework, roles, procedures for internal auditing and QA/QC, handling deviations, sampling strategies, and GHG data collection and management system.\n\n### Methods for Measurement and Documentation\n- **Measurement Techniques:** Monitoring data and parameters will be obtained through direct measurement or representative sampling.\n- **Documentation and Archiving:** Data will be documented, stored, and aggregated utilizing standardized protocols to ensure precision and reliability.\n- **Calibration:** Monitoring equipment will be calibrated following manufacturer's specifications to retain accuracy and uniformity.\n\n### Organizational Structure and Personnel\n- **Organizational Layout:** The Project Implementer (Imp) will oversee monitoring operations, with the Project Proponent (PP) supervising the final monitoring report.\n- **Personnel Roles:** Responsibilities encompass data collection, database entry, report generation, and coordination with project implementers.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC\n- **QA/QC Protocols:** Protocols will be enacted to uphold confidence and precision in sampled parameters.\n- **Documentation:** Non-sampling errors, like non-responses or biases, will be documented for quality control and assurance purposes.\n\n### Handling Deviations\n- **Maximizing Responses:** Measures will be in place to maximize response rates.\n- **Quality Assurance:** Strategies will tackle non-sampling errors, documenting out-of-population cases and refusals.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\n- **Accuracy Levels:** A 95/10 confidence/precision level will be sustained for expansive projects.\n- **Frequency:** Biennial sampling inspections will be carried out.\n- **Stratified Sampling:** Stratified sampling may be implemented to ensure representation.\n- **Measurement Frequency:** Monitoring will occur at least once every two years.\n- **Geographical Considerations:** Monitoring parameters are presumed to be unaffected by geographical locations.\n\n### GHG Data Collection and Management System\n- A schematic diagram illustrating the data collection and management system will be presented to depict the flow and organization of GHG data.\n\nThis monitoring plan guarantees the methodical and efficient collection, analysis, and reporting of monitored data and parameters, adhering to established procedures and quality standards."
