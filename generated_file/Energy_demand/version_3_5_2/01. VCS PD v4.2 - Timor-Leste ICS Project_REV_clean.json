Comments, if any, were solicited through feedback forms during the consultation process. Updates to the project design were made, including detailed presentations and the distribution of non-technical summaries to participants. The insignificance or irrelevance of comments was determined based on the project's presumed minimal negative environmental impact, as it falls under Category C of Decree Law no. 5/2011, indicating negligible environmental effects. This summary highlights the project's proactive approach to public feedback and the rationale behind the assessment of comment significance."

Financial barriers involve high initial costs for project implementation. Regulatory barriers may pertain to policies hindering project execution, while technological barriers relate to inadequate technology support. These barriers must be well-documented and substantiated to justify their credibility.\n\n### Performance Method\nThe project employs a default discount factor to monitor improved cookstove efficiency annually, referencing Equation 5 of the methodology over the 7-year ICS lifetime.

This manuscript furnishes a comprehensive outline of the techniques, organizational framework, accountabilities, internal auditing and QA/QC protocols, handling non-conformities, sampling methodologies, and GHG data gathering and management system.\n\n### Methods for Data Measurement and Reporting\n- Data collection surveys are conducted, and the count of operational improved cook stoves (ICS) is determined through direct measurements or sampling.\n- Adhere to the guidelines laid out in the UNFCCC's Standard for Sampling and Surveys for CDM project activities Version 04.0 for the calibration of monitoring equipment.\n- Implement annual monitoring of ICS efficiency, incorporating a default discount factor to adjust for efficiency degradation per annum.\n\n### Organizational Structure and Responsibilities\n- The team from the Project Proponent based in Dili oversees the collection, recording, and storage of data.\n- Monitoring activities encompass project execution, tracking ICS utilization, conducting surveys, and documenting data for each distribution batch.\n\n### Personnel Competencies\n- Assigned personnel are tasked with monitoring project execution, tracking ICS utilization, conducting surveys, and recording data.\n- Data collection is carried out in accordance with prescribed procedures, be it manual or electronic.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\n- Regular monitoring of equipment and sampling of selected households.\n- Adherence to QA/QC procedures as stipulated by UNFCCC standards for CDM project activities.\n- Internal verification of data and information to ensure credibility and accuracy.\n\n### Handling Non-Conformances\n- Determine sample sizes following established sampling standards.\n- Abide by the UNFCCC's Standard for Sampling and Surveys for addressing non-conformances.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\n- Calculate sample sizes based on 90/10 confidence precision or opt for a simplified approach.\n- Initial survey sample sizes were established for 150 households across two municipalities.\n- Focus on target beneficiaries in villages with ICS installations and adhere to UNFCCC QA/QC guidelines.\n\n### GHG Data Collection and Management System\nFor a visual representation of the data collection and management system, refer to the line diagrams illustrating the GHG monitoring processes.\n\nThis document furnishes a structured and elaborate approach to the monitoring plan, ensuring efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting in alignment with the project's objectives."
