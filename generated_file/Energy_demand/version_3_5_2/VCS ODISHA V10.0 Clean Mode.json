By disseminating high thermal efficient ICS, the project aims to enhance energy transfer during cooking, leading to reduced fuel wood consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative not only combats deforestation but also mitigates health risks associated with indoor air pollution.\n\nTo ensure accessibility, the project provides ICS free of charge to the target populations. Users are educated about the carbon finance generated through ICS usage, which covers the stove's cost and project implementation expenses.\n\nThe project's initial activities are located in Assam, India, with potential expansion to other regions detailed in the document. The ICS will replace traditional open-fire cooking methods, offering a sustainable alternative to non-renewable biomass use.\n\nThe first project activity instance is scheduled for 01-November-2023, with an initial implementation of 1,000 ICS. The project may scale up to 1,000,000 ICS in subsequent phases, managed by EKI Energy Services Limited.\n\nAnticipated annual GHG emission reductions for the initial 1,000 ICS are 6,956 tCO2e, with a total reduction of 48,690 tCO2e for the entire project duration.\n\nIn summary, the project's focus on emission reduction, sustainable technology deployment, and carbon finance utilization underscores its commitment to environmental conservation and a greener future."
