This regulatory surplus signifies that the project is voluntary in nature.\n\n### Additionality Methods\n#### Investment Analysis Method\nThe chosen approach to demonstrate additionality is through the investment analysis method. Each step in this method must be meticulously applied, with clear documentation of outcomes and justifications for identified barriers. It is crucial to reference supporting evidence to validate the identified barriers.\n\n#### Performance Benchmark Metric\nTo establish additionality using the performance method, the project must exhibit performance levels meeting or exceeding the benchmark metric. This necessitates maintaining a detailed database of distributed Improved Cookstoves (ICS) and monitoring their usage based on recognized standards like CDM Sampling protocols or fuel measurement surveys.\n\n#### Activity Method\nWhen employing an activity method for demonstrating additionality, it is essential to ensure alignment with the positive list criteria as outlined in the Methodology Applicability section. This validation statement is vital to confirm the project's compliance with the specified positive list.\n\n#### Reproducibility of Analysis\nProviding comprehensive data, parameters, and credible sources is crucial to enable accurate reproduction of the additionality analysis.

However, understanding the principles surrounding methodology deviations and their implications in quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals is essential. When considering justification for potential deviations, conducting a thorough analysis by comparing calculated values with those reported in relevant scientific literature is crucial. Any differences observed should be carefully examined and explained to ensure transparency and accuracy in the methodology. While no explicit evidence is provided to demonstrate that the absence of deviations will not negatively impact the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals, maintaining a rigorous approach to monitoring and measurement practices is imperative to uphold the integrity of the quantification process. Any deviation in methodology should be limited to criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement only. Deviations extending beyond these boundaries may introduce uncertainties that could affect the reliability of the quantification process. Adhering closely to established criteria and procedures while allowing for flexibility within the specified scope of deviation is advisable. By adhering to these principles and ensuring that any deviations are justified, limited in scope, and rigorously monitored, the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals can be conducted with accuracy and reliability."

Third-party default factors or standards can be adopted to verify GHG emission data, while sample data aids in estimating proportions and mean values for emission reduction calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy adhering to the outlined methodology, utilizing the provided equations, and making informed methodological decisions, projects can accurately quantify their emissions and carbon stock changes. The detailed explanations and justifications promote transparency and reproducibility in the calculation process.\n\n### Appendix: Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet\nPlease refer to the attached emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for a practical application of the procedures and equations discussed in this document.\n\nThis document offers a comprehensive guide on quantifying project emissions and carbon stock changes, incorporating essential equations and methodological considerations for precise and reproducible calculations."

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures should be implemented to ensure accuracy and reliability. In cases where the desired precision is not met, utilizing lower bound values for calculations is recommended to uphold the rigor of the estimation process.\n\n**Reductions and Removals Specification**\n\nThe methodology employed does not differentiate between reductions and removals during the quantification process. Instead, it focuses on determining the net emission reductions achieved by the project without distinct consideration of baseline emissions separately.\n\n**Equations for Quantification**\n\nThe default leakage value of 0.95 serves as the foundation for calculations. An illustrative equation for estimating the quantity of woody biomass saved through the adoption of improved cookstoves is provided to facilitate the quantification process.\n\n**Methodological Choices for Emission Factors and Default Values Selection**\n\nWhen opting for emission factors and default values, it is recommended to adhere to third-party default factors or standards that align with the stipulations outlined in the VCS Program document VCS Methodology Requirements. For example, the default value for the CO2 emission factor from fossil fuels replacing non-renewable woody biomass stands at 26.23 tCO2/TJ, as per the default value in VMR0006 version 1.1.\n\nTo ensure transparency and reproducibility, all calculations pertaining to leakage emissions quantification must be meticulously recorded in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet.
