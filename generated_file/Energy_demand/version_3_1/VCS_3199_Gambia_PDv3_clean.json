The process of determining the baseline scenario is meticulously structured, encompassing multiple steps to ensure the assessment's precision and dependability.\n\nStep 1: Establishing Current Cooking Practices\n\nThe initial phase in defining the baseline scenario entails conducting a thorough evaluation of the existing cooking practices in Gambia. This encompasses data collection on the prevalent stove types, cooking frequency, and fuel consumption levels. Field surveys and household interviews unveiled the prevalent use of traditional open fires and basic stoves, resulting in excessive fuel consumption and substantial greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOutcome: Data analysis exposed the inefficiency of current cooking practices in Gambia, leading to heightened fuel consumption and emissions.\n\nStep 2: Calculating Baseline Emissions\n\nThe subsequent stage involves quantifying the baseline greenhouse gas emissions linked to the prevailing cooking practices. By utilizing emission factors tailored to traditional cooking techniques and fuel varieties, the baseline emissions were approximated based on the fuel usage data derived from the surveys. This step aids in establishing a comprehensive understanding of the environmental repercussions of the existing cooking methods.\n\nOutcome: The baseline greenhouse gas emissions were computed to serve as a yardstick for evaluating the project's efficacy in emission reduction.\n\nKey Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices\n\nThe fundamental assumptions underpinning the baseline scenario revolve around the premise that the dissemination and acceptance of high-efficiency wood-burning cookstoves will substantially curtail fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the baseline. This assumption is rooted in prior research and empirical substantiation showcasing the advantages of advanced cookstove technologies in enhancing fuel efficiency and mitigating emissions.\n\nThe rationale behind opting for high-efficiency wood-burning cookstoves as the intervention strategy is founded on their established efficacy in diminishing fuel usage, enhancing air quality, and fostering sustainable cooking practices. The methodological preference for employing emission factors and fuel consumption data aligns with established norms for evaluating the environmental impact of cookstove initiatives.\n\nReferences:\n- Smith, K.

These deviations have been meticulously evaluated and justified to ensure the accurate quantification of greenhouse gas emission reductions without compromising conservativeness. It is crucial to clarify that these deviations are limited to monitoring and measurement criteria, with no impact on other methodology aspects. One significant deviation involves adjusting the frequency of on-site monitoring visits from monthly to once every two months due to logistical and resource constraints. Extensive analysis supported this change, confirming that the revised monitoring schedule, combined with data validation processes and remote monitoring technologies, remains reliable and accurate in assessing greenhouse gas emission reductions. Rigorous quality control measures have been implemented to uphold data integrity during each visit. Leveraging historical data from similar projects and pilot studies further validates the effectiveness of the revised monitoring approach.

Sampling approaches will be utilized to collect data, with a focus on precision levels, sample sizes, and frequency of measurement. A GHG data collection and management system diagram will visually represent the flow of data for analysis and reporting purposes. By implementing this comprehensive monitoring and analysis process, the project aims to achieve its objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing environmental outcomes in Gambia."
