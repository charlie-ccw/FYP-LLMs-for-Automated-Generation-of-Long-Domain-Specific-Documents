The project aims to introduce ICS as a sustainable alternative to address these environmental and health challenges while also promoting social and economic benefits such as reduced fuel consumption and local employment opportunities.\n\nProcedure and Methodology Application\n\nThe procedure for establishing the baseline scenario involves several key steps to determine the current situation and set the foundation for the project implementation. Firstly, a comprehensive assessment of the existing cooking practices in Mozambique was conducted to understand the prevalent use of traditional open fires and the associated environmental and health impacts. This step included data collection on fuel consumption, emissions levels, deforestation rates, and indoor air quality.\n\nSecondly, a comparative analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential benefits of transitioning to ICS in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing deforestation, and improving indoor air quality. This analysis involved modeling scenarios to estimate the expected impact of widespread ICS adoption on the environment and public health.\n\nOutcome of Each Step\n\nThe assessment of current cooking practices revealed the significant reliance on inefficient and polluting cooking methods, leading to high levels of emissions, deforestation, and indoor air pollution. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the introduction of ICS has the potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate deforestation, and enhance indoor air quality, thereby offering a more sustainable and healthier cooking solution.\n\nKey Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices\n\nThe key assumptions underlying the baseline scenario include the assumption that widespread adoption of ICS will lead to a significant reduction in fuel consumption and associated emissions. The rationale for choosing ICS as the intervention is based on their proven efficacy in improving cooking efficiency, reducing emissions, and enhancing indoor air quality. Methodologically, the project relies on established models and data sources to assess the baseline scenario and project the outcomes of transitioning to ICS.\n\nReferences\n\nThe methodology and data sources used for establishing the baseline scenario and justifying the adoption of ICS in Mozambique include studies by organizations such as the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, the World Health Organization, and academic research on the environmental and health impacts of traditional cooking practices. Additionally, reports from local NGOs and governmental agencies in Mozambique were consulted to gather relevant data on fuel consumption, emissions, and deforestation rates."

These deviations have been carefully evaluated and justified to ensure the accurate quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals without compromising the methodology's integrity. It is important to emphasize that these deviations are solely related to monitoring and measurement criteria and procedures.\n\nOne significant deviation concerns the frequency of on-site monitoring visits. Rather than adhering to the standard monthly visits, the project has opted for bi-monthly visits due to logistical and resource constraints. This adjustment was deemed necessary to maintain monitoring activities efficiently while still capturing essential data on ICS unit performance and usage patterns.\n\nTo validate this deviation, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess its impact on quantifying GHG emission reductions conservatively. The data collected during bi-monthly visits were compared with the expected outcomes from monthly monitoring, demonstrating consistency and effectiveness in tracking emission reductions. Statistical analyses and trend comparisons further supported the reliability and accuracy of the adjusted monitoring schedule.\n\nOverall, the methodology deviations in the monitoring and measurement procedures of the fuel-efficient improved cookstove distribution project in Mozambique have been rigorously justified and substantiated. These deviations have shown no adverse effects on the accuracy of quantifying GHG emission reductions, reinforcing the project's commitment to achieving emission reduction goals while promoting sustainability."

Specific emission factors tailored to the region and fuel types used in traditional cooking methods are selected for precise calculations.\n   - Default values for efficiency rates and carbon sequestration potentials are based on scientific literature and field studies in similar contexts, ensuring the reliability of our calculations.\n\nBy adhering to the outlined procedures and equations, a comprehensive quantification of baseline emissions, carbon stock changes, and reductions/removals associated with the distribution of fuel-efficient ICS in Mozambique is achieved. The detailed calculations are recorded in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet, enhancing transparency and reproducibility of the results."

The quantification process will adhere to the prescribed methodologies approved by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with a focus on comparing baseline emissions from traditional open fire cooking methods with emissions from the distribution of fuel-efficient ICS. Additionally, the assessment of carbon stock changes will involve estimating the carbon stored in biomass that would have been otherwise utilized for fuel, had the project not been implemented. Emission reduction calculations will be based on internationally recognized sources such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, ensuring transparency and accuracy in the calculations. Detailed documentation, including justification for the selection of specific emission factors and default values, will be provided to support the reproducibility and transparency of the quantification process.

This methodical approach encompasses specific procedures and equations aimed at ensuring the transparency and replicability of the emission calculations. Leakage emissions, denoting inadvertent emission increases resulting from project implementation, are quantified by factoring in potential shifts in behavior, technology, or fuel usage that could lead to elevated emissions elsewhere in the system. The calculation of leakage emissions involves a detailed equation involving emissions with the project, baseline emissions, and a leakage factor. Emission reductions, which signify the direct emission decrease achieved by transitioning from traditional open fire cooking to ICS, are calculated distinctly. Similarly, emission removals, accounting for additional carbon sequestration or emission reduction beyond the primary displacement of traditional cooking methods, are quantified separately. The selection of emission factors and default values is meticulously guided by local conditions, stove efficiency, fuel types, and emission sources to ensure the accuracy of the assessments. By incorporating all relevant equations and methodological choices into the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet, stakeholders are empowered to independently reproduce and validate the results, thereby enhancing the credibility and reliability of the emission quantification process."
