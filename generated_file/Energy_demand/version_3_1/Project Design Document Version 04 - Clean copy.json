The options available to beneficiaries in the absence of the project activity for cooking purposes are outlined, including traditional stoves, kerosene, LPG, and improved biomass-based cook stoves. A study by the National Institute of Science, Technology & Development Studies highlights the challenges faced in promoting improved cook stoves due to factors such as affordability and availability of free wood. The prevalence of firewood as a primary cooking fuel in rural areas of Maharashtra is emphasized, indicating a high dependency on traditional biomass sources. The text underscores the barriers to transitioning to commercial fuels like LPG and kerosene in rural areas, citing factors such as affordability and supply constraints. The conclusion is drawn that biomass use in traditional cook stoves remains the most viable baseline option for the target population. The methodology's approach to determining baseline emission factors and calculating emission reductions is detailed, providing a structured framework for assessment. The calculation of emission reductions is outlined, incorporating factors such as woody biomass savings, non-renewable biomass fraction, and emission factors for fossil fuel substitution. The methodology's guidelines for determining baseline parameters, including quantity of woody biomass saved and system efficiency values, are explained. Supporting data from various sources is utilized to estimate parameters such as annual biomass consumption and extraction rates from forest areas. The sustainable extraction potential of firewood from forests and plantations is assessed, considering factors like forest cover types and extraction rates. The estimation of non-renewable biomass fraction and supporting indicators for renewable biomass extraction are elaborated upon, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices and conservation efforts. The text also discusses the demand for fuel wood in Maharashtra, highlighting the reliance on firewood for cooking and the estimated fuel wood requirements. The supply of firewood from forest and tree sources is explored, detailing the sustainable extraction rates and available biomass quantities. The discussion on carbon stock depletion and fuel wood price trends underscores the challenges posed by increased demand and unsustainable extraction practices, leading to forest degradation and rising prices.
