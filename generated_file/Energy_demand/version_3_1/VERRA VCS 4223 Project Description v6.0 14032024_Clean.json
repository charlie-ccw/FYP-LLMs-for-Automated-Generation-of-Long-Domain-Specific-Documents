Regulatory Surplus**\n\n- **Project Location:** Non-Annex 1 country\n- **Project Activities Mandated:** Yes\n- **Systematic Enforcement:** No\n\nThe D.Light's Improved Cooking Project in Kenya is situated in a Non-Annex 1 country, where the project activities are mandated by specific laws and regulatory frameworks. However, despite these mandates, there is evidence of systematic non-enforcement of these regulations. The laws requiring the implementation of energy-efficient improved cookstoves in domestic households and communities are not consistently enforced, leading to a regulatory surplus situation. This lack of enforcement undermines the additionality of the project as the activities are not being carried out as intended by the regulatory framework.\n\n**2. Additionality Methods**\n\n- **Method Selected:** Investment Analysis\n- **Steps Applied:**\n  - Identification of barriers to project implementation\n  - Analysis of financial and non-financial risks\n  - Assessment of financial viability and sustainability\n- **Outcome of Each Step:** \n  - Identified barriers include lack of access to financing, limited awareness of energy-efficient technologies, and resistance to change.\n  - Financial risks include market uncertainties and affordability issues.\n  - Financial viability analysis indicates a positive return on investment over the project lifespan.\n- **Justification of Barriers:** \n  - Lack of access to financing is supported by data showing limited microfinance options in rural areas.\n  - Limited awareness is evidenced by surveys indicating low knowledge of energy-efficient cookstoves.\n  - Resistance to change is based on cultural preferences for traditional cooking methods.\n- **Reproducibility:** \n  - All data, parameters, and sources used in the investment analysis are detailed in the methodology report for transparency and reproducibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the additionality of D.Light's Improved Cooking Project in Kenya is assessed through the investment analysis method, which highlights the financial viability and identified barriers to project implementation. The regulatory surplus due to non-enforcement of mandated laws adds complexity to the project's additionality assessment, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive analysis of both regulatory and financial aspects."

To calculate baseline emissions, the procedure involves assessing emissions linked to traditional cookstove usage in domestic households and applying the formula Baseline Emissions = Activity Data x Emission Factor. Activity data includes the number of traditional cookstoves in use and average daily usage time, while emission factors are chosen from reputable sources like IPCC guidelines or local emission data. Carbon stock changes resulting from the dissemination of energy-efficient improved cookstoves are also evaluated using the formula Carbon Stock Changes = (Carbon Stock with Improved Cookstoves) - (Carbon Stock with Traditional Cookstoves), considering factors like carbon sequestration capacity and biomass fuel degradation rate. The methodology necessitates separating reductions and removals, calculating them using specific procedures and equations, and documenting all equations in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for transparency. Justification for methodological choices, including emission factors and default values, should be based on recent and relevant data, with deviations from standard methodologies explained and aligned with project objectives and the context of the Improved Cooking Project in Kenya.
