The baseline scenario acts as a pivotal reference point that mirrors the existing conditions in the absence of the proposed initiative.\n\nProcedure and Methodology Application:\nThe process of identifying the baseline scenario entails a series of critical stages:\n\n1. Data Collection: Initially, comprehensive data was gathered on the prevalent traditional cookstoves utilized in the target households, encompassing their efficiency, fuel consumption, and emissions levels. This step was imperative to attain a thorough comprehension of the current status.\n\n2. Quantitative Analysis: A quantitative analysis was conducted to evaluate the baseline fuel consumption and emissions stemming from traditional cookstoves. This analysis was instrumental in quantifying the environmental impact and health ramifications associated with conventional stoves.\n\n3. Comparative Study: A comparative study was undertaken to assess the disparities between the existing traditional cookstoves and the proposed high-efficiency wood-burning cookstoves. This phase provided insights into the potential benefits and enhancements achievable through the intervention.\n\nOutcome of Each Step:\nThe data collection process unveiled that the current traditional cookstoves in use exhibited inefficiency, resulting in elevated fuel consumption and substantial greenhouse gas emissions. The quantitative analysis underscored the notable environmental and health hazards posed by the prevailing cooking practices. The comparative study showcased the capacity of high-efficiency cookstoves to markedly curtail fuel consumption, emissions, and enhance overall cooking efficiency.\n\nAssumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices:\n\nKey assumptions underpinning the baseline scenario encompass the availability of adequate funding for the dissemination of high-efficiency cookstoves, the willingness of households to embrace and proficiently utilize the new stoves, and the capability of local communities to uphold and maintain the disseminated cookstoves.\n\nThe rationale driving the baseline scenario is rooted in the imperative necessity to tackle the environmental and health dilemmas linked with traditional cooking practices in South Africa. By transitioning to high-efficiency cookstoves, the intervention aims to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, elevate air quality, and enhance public health outcomes.\n\nMethodological choices were guided by a fusion of scientific research, best practices in stove intervention programs, and consultations with local stakeholders. The selection of high-efficiency wood-burning cookstoves was predicated on their established efficacy in analogous contexts and their potential to deliver the desired outcomes in South Africa.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It is essential to follow clear procedures and equations to calculate both emissions reductions and carbon stock changes accurately. Baseline emissions, associated with inefficient combustion of biomass fuels, can be calculated by estimating baseline fuel consumption and applying appropriate emission factors. Carbon stock changes, reflecting the net change in carbon stored in biomass, necessitate estimating initial carbon stock and considering factors like tree growth rates and land-use changes. Separate calculations for emission reductions and carbon removals, with justifications for methodological choices, ensure accuracy and reproducibility of the quantification process."
