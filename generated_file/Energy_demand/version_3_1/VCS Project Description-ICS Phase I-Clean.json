This systematic approach involves calculating baseline emissions, considering potential negative emissions from carbon stock changes, and distinguishing between reductions and removals. To quantify baseline emissions, we analyze traditional cooking practices, fuel types, and consumption rates, using a specific equation for accurate calculations. Additionally, we assess carbon stock changes resulting from ICS implementation and differentiate between reductions and removals using distinct procedures. Methodological choices, such as selecting emission factors tailored to local fuel types and justifying the use of default values, ensure the accuracy of our calculations. A detailed emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet is developed to transparently document all calculations, facilitating reproducibility and stakeholder understanding. This comprehensive approach guarantees a robust quantification of baseline emissions, carbon stock changes, and emission reductions and removals in the project areas."
