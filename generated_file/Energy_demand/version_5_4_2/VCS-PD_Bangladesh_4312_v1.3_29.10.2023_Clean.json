Various advanced stoves, including the Baldwin adjustable portable stove, Dishari Green Stove, Baldwin double pot, and Dinabandhu stove, will be introduced to replace traditional baseline cookstoves in around 1 million households. The primary goals are to reduce wood consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and indoor air pollution, thereby enhancing air quality and quality of life, particularly for women, while also combating deforestation.\n\n## Technologies/Measures Implemented\n\nThe project will deploy a range of fuel-efficient improved cookstoves, each designed to significantly reduce wood consumption and carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional stoves. These technologies include the Baldwin adjustable portable stove, Dishari Green Stove, Baldwin double pot, and Dinabandhu stove.\n\n## Location\n\nThe project is situated in Bangladesh, where the distribution of improved cookstoves will take place across various regions to benefit a substantial number of households.\n\n## Expected GHG Emission Reductions\n\nBy promoting the use of fuel-efficient cookstoves, the project anticipates generating GHG emission reductions primarily by curbing CO2 emissions linked to the decreased consumption of non-renewable biomass fuel. Each improved cookstove (ICS) is projected to contribute to a reduction of approximately 68 tCO2e per stove over a ten-year period.\n\n## Scenario Before Project Implementation\n\nPrior to the project's initiation, the target population relied on non-renewable wood fuel in inefficient traditional cookstoves, leading to indoor air pollution and associated health issues.\n\n## Estimated Reductions and Removals\n\nThe project is estimated to achieve an annual average GHG emission reduction of 10,882,863 tCO2e, with a total reduction of approximately 108,828,639 tCO2e expected over the entire crediting period. This substantial reduction in emissions underscores the significant environmental impact of the project."

This determination is substantiated by the registration records and consent deeds of individual Improved Cookstoves (ICS) users, which encompass essential details like geographical coordinates, addresses, and explicit confirmation by end users regarding their prior reliance on traditional cooking methods.\n\nThe methodology employed for this purpose comprises several sequential steps, starting with the computation of emission reductions, followed by the application of calculation methods, and concluding with the determination of the average woody biomass consumption of sample stoves to be extrapolated to the entire population using a specific stove model.\n\nEach step in the methodology is meticulously executed by verifying the continuation of non-renewable wood fuel usage by the target demographic to satisfy similar thermal energy demands as facilitated by project cookstoves in the absence of project activities. The outcome of this process consistently reaffirms the prevalent reliance on non-renewable wood fuel for cooking purposes within the community.\n\nThe key assumptions underpinning our approach include the utilization of a cloud-based database management system via a mobile application for data collection, adherence to the 'Standard for Sampling and Surveys for CDM Project Activities and Programme of Activities' for sample size determination, ensuring the representativeness of the sampled households vis-\u00e0-vis the broader project population, and the random selection of samples with a 90% confidence level and a 10% margin of error from the target group.\n\nThese assumptions are rationalized by the distinction between woody biomass consumption and renewable biomass, leading to the estimation of non-renewable biomass utilization in Bangladesh. Methodological choices encompass the application of specific high-power thermal efficiency criteria for the project stove, the selection of five distinct ICS models with varying efficiencies, determination of sample sizes based on established standards, and the comparison of non-renewable biomass estimates with deforestation data.\n\nThe selection of VCS approved methodology VMR0006: Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves, Version 1.1, is justified as the framework to ascertain emission reductions resulting from the project activity. Relevant references supporting our baseline scenario justification include the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 report, Bangladesh Sample Vital Statistics 2020, a report on Market-Based Solutions and Access to Finance Options for Clean Cooking Technologies in Bangladesh, and a report on women's right to clean air in Bangladesh.\n\nThis comprehensive documentation elucidates the rationale behind the baseline scenario identification, the step-by-step application of the methodology, key assumptions, methodological choices, and pertinent references, all contributing to a robust foundation for our project assessment and implementation."
