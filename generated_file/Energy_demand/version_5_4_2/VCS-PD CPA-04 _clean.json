By documenting these calculations in detail, stakeholders can verify the accuracy of the estimated reductions and removals.\n\n### Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nBelow is the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for projects not required to assess permanence risk:\n\n| Vintage Period           | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                     | Example: 10,000                    | Example: 10,000                  | Example: 10,000                 | Example: 20,000             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                     |                                    |                                  |                                 |                              |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                     |                                    |                                  |                                 |                              |\n| Total                    |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                  |                                 |                              |\n\nFor projects required to assess permanence risk, the following table format should be used:\n\n| Vintage Period           | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                     | Example: 10,000                    | Example: 4,000                           | Example: 8,000                  | Example: 8,000                 | Example: 16,000                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                     |                                    |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                     |                                    |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                     |\n| Total                    |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                     |\n\nBy following this structured approach and providing clear calculations, the reader can understand and replicate the estimation of GHG emission reductions and removals effectively."
