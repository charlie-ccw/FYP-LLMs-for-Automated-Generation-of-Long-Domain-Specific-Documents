Therefore, the quantification focuses on overall emission reductions rather than distinguishing between reductions and removals.\n\n### Relevant Equations\nThe relevant equations for quantifying project emissions and carbon stock changes are Equation (1) and Equation (3) as outlined in the provided document excerpts. These equations form the basis for calculating emission reductions and assessing carbon stock changes.\n\n### Methodological Choices\nSeveral methodological choices need to be explained and justified in the quantification process.
