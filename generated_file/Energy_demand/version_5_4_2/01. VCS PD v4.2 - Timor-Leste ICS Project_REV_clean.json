This document provides detailed information on the methods for measuring, recording, storing, aggregating, collating, and reporting on monitored data and parameters, the organizational structure, responsibilities, and competencies of personnel involved in monitoring activities, internal auditing and QA/QC procedures, handling non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan, sampling approaches used, and potential line diagrams for displaying the GHG data collection and management system.\n\n## Methods for Measuring, Recording, Storing, Aggregating, and Reporting Data\nThe project utilizes various methodologies and tools such as VMR0006, CDM Standard on Sampling and surveys, CDM Tool 30, and CDM Tool 33 for monitoring activities. Data and information are electronically stored in a database system, and monitoring reports are generated annually or biennially.\n\n## Procedures for Calibrating Monitoring Equipment\nWhile specific procedures for calibrating monitoring equipment are not explicitly mentioned, regular calibration practices must be implemented to ensure accurate data collection.\n\n## Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities\nCollaborators in villages are assigned to monitor usage and raise awareness of households regarding the Improved Cook Stoves (ICS). Data collection is conducted from a statistically valid sample of ICS in the database using field surveys. Annual and biennial surveys of communities where ICS have been distributed are essential for monitoring activities.\n\n## Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\nInternal auditing and QA/QC procedures involve annual and biennial surveys, kitchen observations, interviews with primary cooks, and capturing photos of the cooking area with GPS coordinates linked to the photo.\n\n## Handling Non-Conformances with the Validated Monitoring Plan\nThe procedures for handling non-conformances are detailed in section 5.3 of the Monitoring Plan document from the VCS PD v4.2 for the Timor-Leste ICS Project.\n\n## Sampling Approaches\nThe project employs a simple random sampling approach with a minimum sample size of 100 households surveyed. A conservative approach of surveying 150 samples is adopted to ensure robust data collection. The focus of surveys includes checking sampled households for the presence and usage of both the baseline stove and the project stove for cooking.\n\n## Line Diagrams for GHG Data Collection and Management System\nWhile no line diagrams were found in the provided information, visual representations of the GHG data collection and management system can enhance understanding and communication of the monitoring process.\n\nIn conclusion, the Monitoring Plan plays a crucial role in ensuring the effective collection, analysis, and reporting of monitored data and parameters, contributing to the success of the project's environmental initiatives."
