This document outlines the procedure for quantifying project emissions and/or carbon stock changes in accordance with the applied methodology. The methodology focuses on determining net emission reductions achieved by the project, where carbon stock increases (sinks) can exceed project emissions. The document includes all relevant equations, methodological choices, and procedures for calculating emission reductions and removals.\n\n## Quantification of Project Emissions\nThe methodology employed does not account for project emissions separately but quantifies net emission reductions achieved by the project. The share of operating stoves is determined based on sampling procedures conducted by the project proponent. The relevant equation for quantifying emission reductions by improved cook stoves is as follows:\n\\[ER_{y,i,j} = B_{y,saving,i,j} \\times f_{NRB,y} \\times NCV_{woodyfuel} \\times (EF_{woodyfuel,CO2} + EF_{woodyfuel,non-CO2}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(ER_{y,i,j}\\): Emission reductions by improved cook stove of type i and batch j\n- \\(B_{y,saving,i,j}\\): Quantity of woody biomass saved per improved cook stove of type i and batch j during year y\n- \\(f_{NRB,y}\\): Fraction of woody biomass that can be established as non-renewable biomass\n- \\(NCV_{woodyfuel}\\): Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass\n- \\(EF_{woodyfuel,CO2}\\): CO2 emission factor for the use of wood fuel in the baseline scenario\n- \\(EF_{woodyfuel,non-CO2}\\): Non-CO2 emission factor for the use of wood fuel in the baseline scenario\n- \\(N_{y,i,j}\\): Number of improved cook stoves of type i and batch j operating during year y\n- 0.95: Discount factor to account for leakage\n\n## Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\nSimilarly, the methodology quantifies net emission reductions achieved by the project rather than baseline emissions separately. The quantification of carbon stock changes is integrated into the overall assessment of emission reductions achieved by the project.\n\n## Methodological Choices and Justifications\nSeveral methodological choices need to be explained and justified during the quantification process. These include the purpose of data collection, calculation methods, sample size determination, population size consideration, expected mean of improved cook stove thermal efficiency, expected standard deviation, confidence level, and relative precision. Each choice should be carefully considered to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the quantification process.\n\n## Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values\nThe procedures for selecting emission factors and default values involve using a statistically valid sample of locations where devices are deployed to determine parameter values for calculating emission reductions. Biennial inspections require a 95% confidence interval and a 10% margin of error, while annual inspections require a 90% confidence interval and a 10% margin of error.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the quantification of project emissions and carbon stock changes is essential for evaluating the environmental impact of a project. By following the outlined procedures, equations, and methodological choices, project proponents can accurately assess the net emission reductions achieved by their initiatives. Transparency and thorough documentation of the quantification process are key to ensuring the credibility and reproducibility of the calculations."
