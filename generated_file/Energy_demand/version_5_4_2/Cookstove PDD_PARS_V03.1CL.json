We will explain the application of these equations to enable reproducibility and provide calculations for key equations for annual reductions or removals.\n\n### Equations for Quantification\n1. **Net GHG Emission Reductions:**\n   \\[\n   ER_{y,I,j} = By_{savings,i.j} \\times NCV_{wood \\, fuel} \\times fNRB_{y} \\times (EF_{wf,CO2} + EF_{wf,non \\, CO2}) \\times Ny_{I,j} \\times 0.95\n   \\]\n2. **Efficiency Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\eta_{new} = \\frac{\\text{Energy output}}{\\text{Energy input}}\n   \\]\n3. **Savings Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   By_{savings,i.j} = \\frac{\\eta_{old} - \\eta_{new}}{\\eta_{old}}\n   \\]\n\n### Application of Equations\nThe equations are applied as follows:\n- **Equation 1 and 2:** Utilized to calculate net GHG emission reductions.\n- **Equation 3:** Used for determining savings based on efficiency variances between baseline and improved cookstoves.\n\n### Annual Calculations for Reductions or Removals\nTo reproduce annual calculations, the methodology equations must be employed. The key components necessary for the calculation are outlined within the equations.\n\n### Separation of Reductions and Removals\nReductions and removals are distinguished by estimating woody biomass saved through the implementation of improved cook stoves as per the approved methodology.\n\n### Estimated Emissions and VCUs for Vintage Periods\nFor vintage periods, the estimated values are as follows:\n- **Estimated Baseline Emissions:** 3,132,379 tCO2e\n- **Estimated Project Emissions:** 0 tCO2e\n- **Leakage Emissions:** 0 tCO2e\n- **Reduction VCUs:** 3,132,379 tCO2e\n- **Removal VCUs:** 0 tCO2e\n- **Total VCUs:** 3,132,379 tCO2e\n\n### Tables for Project Crediting Periods\n#### Projects Not Requiring Permanence Risk Assessment\n| Vintage Period           | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                      | Example: 10,000                     | Example: 10,000                  | Example: 10,000                 | Example: 20,000               |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                     |                                   |                                  |                               |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                     |                                   |                                  |                               |\n| Total                    |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                   |                                  |                               |\n\n#### Projects Requiring Permanence Risk Assessment\n| Vintage Period           | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                      | Example: 10,000                     | Example: 4,000                           | Example: 8,000                  | Example: 8,000                 | Example: 16,000                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                     |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                     |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                     |\n| Total                    |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                     |\n\nBy following the outlined procedures and equations, stakeholders can accurately quantify and document estimated GHG emission reductions and removals for project crediting periods."
