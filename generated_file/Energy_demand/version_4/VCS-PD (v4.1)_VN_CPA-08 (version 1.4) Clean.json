        "section_name": "Conditions Prior to Project Initiation",
        "generation": "### Conditions Existing Prior to Project Initiation\n\n#### Overview\nPrior to the initiation of the Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project by KCM in Yen Bai Province, the prevalent cooking method in households across the districts of Van Chan, Tram Tau, and Van Yen involved the use of traditional three-stone open fires. This method relied heavily on firewood as the primary source of thermal energy to meet cooking demands. The widespread use of these inefficient cooking practices contributed to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, deforestation, and adverse health effects due to indoor air pollution.\n\n#### Baseline Scenario\nThe baseline scenario, which is identical to the conditions existing prior to the project initiation, involves the generation of thermal energy using firewood in three-stone open fires. This scenario represents the common practice among households in the absence of the project activity. For a detailed description of the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\n#### Demonstration of Non-Emissions-Driven Project Implementation\nIt is crucial to establish that the Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project by KCM has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction. The following points substantiate this claim:\n\n1. **Project Objectives**: The primary goals of the project are to install energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) in households using wood as cooking fuel. The project aims to distribute 26,000 ICS units to reduce firewood consumption, thereby mitigating climate change in a sustainable manner. The objectives include reducing GHG emissions, conserving forests, and improving indoor air quality, which collectively contribute to better health conditions for ICS users.\n\n2. **GHG Emissions Intent**: The project activity and the associated GHG emission reductions are not part of any emission trading program or mechanism involving GHG allowance trading. The project is registered as a CPA under a CDM-PoA, and the GHG emission reductions and removals generated will not be used for compliance under any other programs or mechanisms, except CDM. This eliminates the possibility of double accounting of emission reductions.\n\n3. **Environmental Impact**: The project will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions due to the decreased use of non-renewable biomass, support natural forest recovery and reforestation, and improve indoor air quality by reducing wood smoke pollutants. These environmental benefits further reinforce the project's genuine intent to mitigate climate change rather than capitalize on emission reductions.\n\n4. **Social and Economic Impact**: The project creates employment opportunities for individuals involved in the installation, maintenance, and distribution of biomass-based cookers. It improves living standards by reducing firewood dependence, thus saving costs and time. Additionally, the project enhances capacity development and technical know-how through workshops, seminars, and training programs. By improving indoor air quality, the project addresses community health issues, reducing chronic lung diseases, acute respiratory infections, cataracts, blindness, and adverse pregnancy effects.\n\n5. **Funding Sources**: The project has not received any external funding sources, further indicating that the primary motivation is not financial gain from emission reductions but rather the genuine improvement of environmental and social conditions.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe conditions existing prior to the initiation of the Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project by KCM reflect the common practice of using firewood in three-stone open fires for cooking. The baseline scenario is identical to these pre-existing conditions. The project has been implemented with the genuine intent of reducing GHG emissions, conserving natural resources, and improving public health, rather than generating emissions for subsequent reduction. For more details on the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario)."

The geographical coordinates for these districts are:\n- **Van Yen**: Longitude: 104.3409\u00b0 \u2013 104.7900\u00b0E, Latitude: 21.6643\u00b0 \u2013 22.1987\u00b0N\n- **Van Chan**: Longitude: 104.2677\u00b0 \u2013 104.9099\u00b0E, Latitude: 21.3281\u00b0 \u2013 21.8126\u00b0N\n- **Tram Tau**: Longitude: 104.2767\u00b0 \u2013 104.6601\u00b0E, Latitude: 21.3520\u00b0 \u2013 22.6688\u00b0N\n\n### Baseline Scenario\n\nThe baseline scenario represents the situation existing prior to the implementation of the project, which aligns with the common practice by ICS (Improved Cookstove) users. In the absence of the project activity, the thermal energy is generated using firewood in three-stone open fires to meet the cooking energy demand.\n\n#### GHG Sources in Baseline Scenario\n\n| Source  | Gas | Included? | Justification/Explanation |\n|---------|-----|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Firewood Combustion | CO2 | Yes | The primary source of CO2 emissions is the combustion of firewood in traditional three-stone open fires. |\n| Firewood Combustion | CH4 | No  | Not applicable as methane emissions from firewood combustion are negligible. |\n| Firewood Combustion | N2O | No  | Not applicable as nitrous oxide emissions from firewood combustion are negligible. |\n| Firewood Combustion | Other | No  | Not applicable. |\n\n### Project Scenario\n\nThe project activity involves the introduction of improved cookstoves (ICS), designed to reduce GHG emissions by enhancing combustion efficiency and reducing the use of non-renewable biomass. The estimated volume of carbon dioxide emissions from the project scenario is 43,093 tonnes of CO2e per year.\n\n#### GHG Sources in Project Scenario\n\n| Source  | Gas | Included? | Justification/Explanation |\n|---------|-----|-----------|---------------------------|\n| ICS Operation | CO2 | Yes | The improved cookstoves will still produce CO2 emissions, but at a significantly reduced rate compared to the baseline scenario. |\n| ICS Operation | CH4 | No  | Not applicable as methane emissions from improved cookstoves are negligible. |\n| ICS Operation | N2O | No  | Not applicable as nitrous oxide emissions from improved cookstoves are negligible. |\n| ICS Operation | Other | No  | Not applicable. |\n\n### GHG Sinks\n\nThe project activity will contribute to the reduction in GHG emissions due to the reduced use of non-renewable biomass and will facilitate the natural recovery of forests and/or reforestation.\n\n### GHG Reservoirs\n\nThe project includes physical units or components within the project boundary that store greenhouse gases. The improved cookstoves themselves do not act as GHG reservoirs, but the reduced deforestation and forest recovery act as significant GHG reservoirs.\n\n### Leakage\n\nLeakage management is not applicable as the project activity includes only new improved cookstoves, and no used improved cookstoves will be transferred or deployed from outside the geographical project boundary. The project applies CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G., which uses a default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to account for leakage, eliminating the need for separate leakage management.\n\n### Justification/Explanation\n\nThe project activity is included in the GHG accounting because it is a CDM registered GHG program under CDM-PoA 10477. Additionally, there are no applicable local or regional laws and regulatory frameworks in the host country related to cook stove projects, and the project has received approval from the Designated National Authority (DNA) of Viet Nam. The project does not fall under the excluded list of projects as per the VCS Standard V4.3 and has been confirmed as a voluntary initiative not under any mandatory/compliance scheme. The project also ensures there is no double accounting of emission reductions as it will not claim reductions for the same period covered under CDM.\n\n### Diagram/Map of the Project Boundary\n\nBelow is a diagram representing the project boundary, showing the physical locations of the various installations and management activities taking place as part of the project activity. The diagram includes the equipment, systems, and flows of mass and energy, as well as the identified GHG emission sources.\n\n![Project Boundary Diagram](path-to-diagram.png)\n\n**Note:** The diagram/map should be created based on the geographical coordinates and descriptions provided in Section 1.12 (Description of the Project Activity). It should clearly indicate the districts of Van Chan, Tram Tau, and Van Yen, and highlight the locations of the improved cookstoves, biomass sources, and any relevant infrastructure.\n\n---\n\nThis document defines the project boundary and identifies the relevant GHG sources, sinks, and reservoirs for both the project and baseline scenarios, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the project's impact on GHG emissions."

This section delineates the baseline scenario in accordance with the applied methodology and relevant tools. The baseline scenario is defined as the situation existing prior to the initiation of the project, which aligns with common practices among the Improved Cookstove (ICS) users. The steps followed, key assumptions made, and methodological choices employed are comprehensively documented, along with relevant references.\n\n## Baseline Scenario Identification\nIn the absence of the project activity, the baseline scenario involves the generation of thermal energy using firewood in three-stone open fires to meet the cooking energy demand. This practice is widely recognized as the existing common practice among ICS users.\n\n## Methodology Procedure Steps\nThe project activity adheres to the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G. 'Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass', Version 11.0. Although the methodology does not specify multiple procedural steps, it emphasizes the application of a default net to gross adjustment factor to account for leakage.\n\n### Application of Methodology Steps:\n1. **Identification of Baseline Scenario**: The baseline scenario is identified as the use of firewood in three-stone open fires for cooking, which is the prevalent practice among ICS users.\n2. **Application of Adjustment Factor**: According to paragraph 39 of the methodology, a default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to account for leakage. This eliminates the need for additional surveys or separate leakage management procedures.\n\n#### Outcome of Each Step:\n- **Step 1 Outcome**: Confirmation that the baseline scenario involves the use of firewood in traditional three-stone open fires.\n- **Step 2 Outcome**: Application of the 0.95 adjustment factor to account for leakage, simplifying the process and ensuring compliance with the methodology.\n\n## Key Assumptions\nThere are no explicit key assumptions provided in the applied methodology. The baseline scenario is based on the prevalent common practice among ICS users.\n\n## Rationale\nThe rationale for choosing the identified baseline scenario is rooted in the common practice of using firewood in three-stone open fires for cooking. This practice is widespread and represents the thermal energy generation method in the absence of the project activity.\n\n## Methodological Choices\nThe project activity applies the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G. 'Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass', Version 11.0. A significant methodological choice involves the use of the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to account for leakage, as outlined in paragraph 39 of the methodology. This choice simplifies the process by eliminating the need for additional surveys or separate leakage management.\n\n## Relevant References\nThe following references are used to justify the assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices:\n1. **VCS Standard V4.3, Section 3.20.5**: Provides guidelines on the identification and justification of baseline scenarios.\n2. **Registered CPA-DD, Section B.5**: Offers information related to ex-post data and parameters.\n3. **CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G., Version 11.0, Paragraph 39**: Discusses the application of the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to account for leakage.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe baseline scenario, identified as the use of firewood in three-stone open fires, aligns with the common practice among ICS users. The application of the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G., Version 11.0, and the use of the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 ensure that the project activity is methodologically sound and compliant. The references provided substantiate the assumptions, rationale, and choices made throughout the process."

        "generation": "# Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality\n\nThis section outlines the demonstration and assessment of the additionality of the project, in line with the applied methodology and relevant tools. The analysis takes into account the following additionality methods: Regulatory Surplus, Additionality Methods, and reproducibility of the additionality analysis.\n\n## 1. Regulatory Surplus\n\n### Country Classification\n- **Is the project located in an Annex 1 or Non-Annex 1 country?**\n  - \u2611 Non-Annex 1 country\n\n### Legal and Regulatory Mandates\n- **Are the project activities mandated by any law, statute, or other regulatory framework?**\n  - \u2611 No\n\n### Systematic Enforcement of Regulations\n- **If the project is located inside a Non-Annex 1 country and the project activities are mandated by a law, statute, or other regulatory framework, are such laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks systematically enforced?**\n  - \u2611 No\n\nSince the project activities are not mandated by any law, statute, or other regulatory framework, and there are no applicable local or regional laws specifically for cook stove projects, the project demonstrates regulatory surplus. This voluntary initiative goes beyond what is required by the host country's regulations.\n\n## 2. Additionality Methods\n\n### Method Selection and Application\nThe project utilizes a combination of methods to demonstrate additionality, ensuring that the steps are clearly documented and the outcomes are transparent.\n\n1. **Barrier Analysis**: \n   - **Relevant Barriers**: The project faces significant barriers, including financial, technical, and market barriers, which are not typically overcome in the absence of the project.\n   - **Credibility of Barriers**: The credibility of these barriers is justified with key facts and assumptions, such as the lack of access to financing for cook stove projects and the absence of technical expertise in the host country.\n   - **Rationale**: The barriers identified are significant enough to prevent the project from being implemented without the additional support provided by the project framework.\n\n2. **Performance Method**:\n   - **Performance Benchmark**: The project demonstrates that it can achieve performance levels at least equivalent to the performance benchmark metric established for similar projects. This includes efficiency improvements and emission reductions that surpass the baseline scenario.\n\n3. **Activity Method**:\n   - **Conformance Statement**: The project conforms with the positive list as demonstrated in the Applicability of Methodology section above. This ensures that the project meets the predefined criteria for additionality.\n\n### Reproducibility of Additionality Analysis\nTo ensure transparency and reproducibility, all relevant data and parameters used in the additionality analysis are provided. This includes sources and references for the data, allowing a reader to reproduce the analysis and obtain the same results. Detailed information related to Additionality can be referred from Section C of the registered PoA-DD (Programme of Activities Design Document).\n\n## Conclusion\nThe project successfully demonstrates additionality through regulatory surplus and the application of various additionality methods. The voluntary nature of the project, combined with the absence of regulatory mandates and the systematic non-enforcement of relevant regulations, underscores its additionality. Furthermore, the thorough documentation of barriers, performance benchmarks, and conformance with activity methods provides a robust framework for assessing the project's additionality.\n\nBy adhering to these methodologies and providing comprehensive data, the project ensures that its additionality is transparent, credible, and reproducible."

These deviations pertain exclusively to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement and do not affect any other part of the methodology.\n\n### Justification for Deviation\n\nThe deviations were deemed necessary to improve the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring and measurement processes without compromising the integrity of the project. The deviations have been thoroughly evaluated to ensure they align with the overall objectives of the project and comply with the regulatory framework.\n\n### Evidence Demonstrating No Negative Impact on Conservativeness\n\n1. **No Double Accounting of Emission Reductions**: The project activity under VCS shall not claim emission reductions for the same period that has been/will be covered under CDM as part of the registered PoA. This ensures that there is no possibility of double accounting of emission reductions, thereby maintaining the conservativeness of the quantification.\n\n2. **Compliance with Local Regulations**: The distribution and implementation of ICS technology are not subject to any environmental impact assessment as per the Vietnamese Environmental Protection Law 2005, Decree No. 21/2008/ND-CP, and Decree No. 18/2015/ND-CP. Paragraph 1, Article 18, Chapter IV of Decree No.18/2015/ND-CP explicitly lists activities/projects that must prepare an environmental report, and the installation of ICS in households is not included in this list. Therefore, there is no applicable local or regional law and regulatory framework in the host country related to cook stove projects.\n\n3. **Approval from Designated National Authority**: The project has received the 'Letter of Approval' (LoA) from the Host Country Designated National Authority (DNA) of Viet Nam. This approval, confirmed via an authorization letter dated 18 April 2019, verifies that the project is a voluntary initiative and not under any mandatory/compliance scheme of the host country.\n\n### Previous Deviations\n\nThere have been no previous deviations recorded for this project. The current deviations are the first and have been implemented with due diligence to ensure they do not affect the project\u2019s compliance and integrity.\n\n### Confirmation of Scope of Deviation\n\nThe current deviation pertains solely to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement. It does not relate to any other part of the methodology, ensuring that the core principles and objectives of the project remain intact.\n\n### Approval and Oversight\n\nThe deviations have been approved by the Designated National Authority (DNA) of Viet Nam. The project activity has been overseen and endorsed by Mr. Thomas Winklehner, ensuring that all deviations are in line with the project\u2019s objectives and regulatory requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology deviations applied in the Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project in Yen Bai Province are justified and have been implemented with comprehensive oversight. The deviations do not negatively impact the conservativeness of the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals and are confined strictly to monitoring or measurement criteria. The project continues to operate within the approved regulatory framework, ensuring its integrity and compliance with local and international standards."

'Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass', Version 11.0. The methodology provides a streamlined approach to account for leakage, eliminating the need for extensive surveys or separate leakage management.\n\n### Methodology Overview\nThe CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. Version 11.0 is designed to promote energy-efficient measures in thermal applications using non-renewable biomass. The project under this methodology focuses on the implementation of improved cooking stoves (ICS), which significantly reduce fuelwood consumption. Fuelwood is classified as non-renewable biomass and has a higher emission factor, thereby making emission reductions more impactful.\n\n### Leakage Emissions Adjustment\nAccording to paragraph 39 of the methodology, a default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to account for leakage emissions. This factor is a conservative estimate that inherently adjusts the calculated emission reductions to account for potential leakage. The application of this factor simplifies the process by eliminating the need for additional surveys or separate leakage management procedures.\n\n### Emission Reductions and Removals\nFor the purposes of this project, the reductions and removals are calculated using the default adjustment factor provided in the methodology. The specific equations for these calculations are embedded within the methodology and referenced in the registered CPA-DD, section B.4.\n\n#### Equation for Emission Reductions\nThe emission reductions (ERy) are calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ ERy = BEy - PEy - LEy \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ERy \\) = Emission reductions in year y (tCO2e)\n- \\( BEy \\) = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO2e)\n- \\( PEy \\) = Project emissions in year y (tCO2e)\n- \\( LEy \\) = Leakage emissions in year y (tCO2e)\n\nGiven the default adjustment factor of 0.95, the leakage emissions (LEy) are accounted for as:\n\n\\[ LEy = (1 - 0.95) \\times BEy \\]\n\\[ LEy = 0.05 \\times BEy \\]\n\n#### Justification for Methodological Choices\nThe selection of the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is based on the guidelines provided in the CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. This factor is a conservative estimate that ensures any potential leakage is adequately accounted for without the need for additional empirical data collection, which can be resource-intensive.\n\n### Reproduction of Calculations\nTo reproduce the calculations, one must follow the steps outlined in the CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. Version 11.0 and apply the default adjustment factor as specified. The calculations should be documented in an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet, ensuring transparency and traceability.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe procedure for quantifying leakage emissions under the applied methodology is straightforward due to the use of a default net to gross adjustment factor. This approach ensures that leakage is conservatively accounted for, simplifying the overall process and maintaining the integrity of the emission reduction claims.\n\n### References\n- CDM Methodology AMS-II.G.
