Baseline emissions may be negative in cases where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions.\n\n### Methodology Overview\n\nThe quantification process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Baseline Emissions Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the baseline emissions using the equation:\n     ```\n     ERy = By,savings X fNRB,y X NCV biomass X EFprojectedfossilfuel\n     ```\n   - Where:\n     - ERy = Baseline emissions for year y\n     - By,savings = Biomass savings for year y\n     - fNRB,y = Fraction of non-renewable biomass for year y\n     - NCV biomass = Net calorific value of biomass\n     - EFprojectedfossilfuel = Emission factor for projected fossil fuel consumption\n\n2. **Reductions and Removals**:\n   - Specify the reductions and removals separately as per the methodology guidelines provided in section B 6.4 of PDD of the UNFCCC registered CDM project reference no. 8522.\n\n3. **Methodological Choices**:\n   - The default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ is utilized for estimating emission reductions in the baseline scenario for the combustion of fuel wood.\n\n### Reproducing Calculations\n\nTo reproduce the calculations, refer to the provided equation and input the relevant data for each parameter to derive the baseline emissions. Ensure that the calculations are performed accurately to obtain reliable results.\n\n### Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nInclude all calculations in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet to document the quantification process comprehensively. Organize the spreadsheet to display the input data, equations, calculations, and final results clearly for reference and verification purposes.\n\nBy following these procedures and guidelines, the quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes can be accurately conducted, providing valuable insights into the environmental impact of the project."
