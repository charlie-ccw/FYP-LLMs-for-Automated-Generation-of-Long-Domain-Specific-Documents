The methodology applied for quantifying emissions and carbon stock changes is based on the reduction in non-renewable biomass fuel consumption in the efficient project stoves compared to baseline stoves.\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. **Quantifying Carbon Stock Changes:** Carbon stock changes are calculated using the equations:\n   - `ERy,i,j = By,saving,i,j * fNRB,y * NCV * wood_fuel * (EFwf,CO2 + EFwf,non CO2) * Ny,i,j * 0.95`\n   - `By,saving,i,j = Bold * (1 - eta_old / eta_new,i,j)`\n   - `By,saving,i,j = By=1,new,i,survey * (eta_new,y,i,j / eta_old - 1)`\n\n2. **Quantifying Emission Reductions:** Emission reductions are quantified based on the reduction in non-renewable biomass fuel consumption in the efficient project stoves compared to baseline stoves.\n\n**Equations Used:**\n- Equations 1 and 2 are utilized in the quantification process to calculate net GHG emission reductions by replacing traditional wood-based stoves with improved cook stoves.\n\n**Methodological Choices Justification:**\nThe choice of using the CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in the baseline scenario is justified by the IPCC default value of 112 tCO2/TJ from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\nBy following the above procedure and equations, the reader can reproduce the calculations for quantifying project emissions and carbon stock changes effectively. The methodology focuses on emission reductions resulting from reduced non-renewable biomass fuel consumption in the project stoves. \n\nFor further details and calculations, refer to the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet provided separately."

        "generation": "## Quantification of Leakage Emissions Procedure\n\nThe quantification of leakage emissions in accordance with the applied methodology involves a detailed procedure that considers leakage as default 0.95. Additionally, default values of 0.1 or 0.2 are used based on the type of baseline device, with weighted average values applied if multiple baseline devices are being replaced.\n\n### Emission Reductions\n\nEmission reductions are calculated using Equation 5:\n\n\u03b7new,y,i,j = \u03b7p \u00d7 (DFn)y\u22121 \u00d7 0.94\n\n### Emission Removal\n\nEquations 1 and 2 are utilized to calculate emission removals. Equation (1) calculates emission reductions in t CO2e during year y, while Equation (2) quantifies the amount of woody biomass saved per improved cook stove of type i and batch j during year y.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nThe Methodological Choices for the Kenya Jiko Kisasa ICS Program VCS PD_Clean include the methodology for the installation of high-efficiency firewood cookstoves, version 1.1.\n\n### Emission Factors\n\nThe CO2 emission factor for the use of wood fuel in the baseline scenario is 112 tCO2/TJ, based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\n### Default Values\n\nA default value of 0.1 is employed when the baseline device is a three-stone fire using firewood or a conventional device with no improved combustion air supply or flue gas ventilation, without a grate or a chimney.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nThe calculation spreadsheet includes all calculations for net GHG emission reductions and removals by applying Equations 1 and 2.\n\nBy following the outlined procedure and equations, along with justifying the methodological choices made, the quantification of leakage emissions can be accurately conducted and the reductions and removals can be calculated effectively."

The calculations involve applying Equations 1 and 2, which incorporate various variables and calculations as detailed below.\n\n### Procedure for Quantification\n\n#### Equations Used\nThe quantification process involves the following equations:\n1. Equation 1: Net GHG Emission Reductions\n   - Formula: Net Reductions = \u03a3(Ny,i,j) * CO2 Emission Factor\n   - Variables: Ny,i,j (Number of project devices of type i and batch j operating during year y), CO2 Emission Factor\n\n2.
