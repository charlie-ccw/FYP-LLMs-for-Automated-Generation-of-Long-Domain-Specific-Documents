The technologies to be implemented include TLC-CQC Rocket Stoves with a minimum efficiency of 25%. The project aims to target the complete set of appliances deployed under the initiative.\n\n**Location**\n\nThe project will be implemented in Ghana.\n\n**GHG Emission Reductions**\n\nBy introducing improved cookstoves, the project is expected to generate greenhouse gas emission reductions by replacing the current practice of cooking on open fire stoves with more efficient ICS that burns wood effectively. This shift will lead to significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n**Pre-Implementation Scenario**\n\nPrior to the project initiation, the target population relied on non-renewable wood fuel for their thermal energy needs. This was done using inefficient three-stone fires or conventional systems that lacked improved combustion air supply mechanisms and flue gas ventilation systems.\n\n**Reduction Estimates**\n\nThe project is estimated to achieve an annual average reduction of 1,126,602 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, with a total reduction of 11,266,021 metric tons of CO2 equivalent over the project's lifespan.\n\nBy implementing these improved cookstoves, the project aims to not only enhance energy efficiency but also contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby promoting sustainable practices in cooking methods."
