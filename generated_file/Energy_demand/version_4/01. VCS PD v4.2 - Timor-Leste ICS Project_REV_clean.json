By introducing these technologies, the project aims to reduce harmful emissions, particularly indoor air emissions. Additionally, the initiative seeks to enhance the economic, health, local environment, and overall quality of life for the communities involved.\n\n**Technologies Implemented:**\n\nThe project will utilize a cloud-based storage solution powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to securely store and manage data related to the implementation and impact of the energy-efficient cookstoves.\n\n**Project Location:**\n\nTimor-Leste\n\n**GHG Emission Reduction Explanation:**\n\nThe implementation of improved cooking stoves will lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. By replacing traditional three-stone firewood cookstoves with higher efficiency Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS), the project will decrease the amount of fuel required for cooking. This shift will result in reduced GHG emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability.\n\n**Pre-Implementation Scenario:**\n\nPrior to the project's implementation, a comprehensive survey was conducted on the existing three-stone firewood cookstoves in Timor-Leste. The survey revealed that these traditional stoves, which primarily utilized firewood, emitted significant amounts of greenhouse gases. A value of 11.27% was derived from the survey and applied for the calculation of Emission Reduction.\n\n**Estimates:**\n\n- **Annual Average Reductions:** The project estimates a significant annual reduction in GHG emissions or carbon dioxide removals due to the adoption of improved cooking stoves.\n- **Total Reductions:** The project expects to achieve a total reduction of 5,074,630 units, highlighting the substantial impact it aims to make in mitigating GHG emissions and promoting environmental sustainability.\n\nThis project represents a crucial step towards addressing environmental challenges, improving community health, and fostering sustainable development in Timor-Leste through the adoption of innovative technologies and sustainable practices."

This assumption is aligned with the methodology and tools utilized for the project, including VMR0006 on Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves, CDM Standard on Sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities, CDM Tool 30 on Calculation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass, and CDM Tool 33 on Default values for common parameters.\n\n**Procedure for Baseline Scenario Identification**\n\nThe procedure for identifying the baseline scenario involves several key steps. Firstly, an assessment is conducted to evaluate the current cooking practices and energy sources in the target areas. Subsequently, data is collected using the methodologies outlined in VMR0006 and the CDM Standard on Sampling and surveys. This data is then analyzed using CDM Tool 30 to calculate the fraction of non-renewable biomass being used. Finally, default values for common parameters are applied utilizing CDM Tool 33 to ascertain the baseline scenario for the project.\n\n**Explanation of Key Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices**\n\nWhile no specific key assumptions were identified, the rationale behind the methodological choices for the Timor-Leste ICS Project is rooted in the objective of enhancing energy efficiency through the dissemination of improved cookstoves. This initiative is crucial in light of Timor-Leste's classification as a Least Developed Country (LDC) and is in line with the nation's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) objectives related to mitigation activities and the promotion of clean energy utilization.\n\n**References**\n\nThe justification for the assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices for the Timor-Leste ICS Project is supported by references to VMR0006, the CDM Standard on Sampling and surveys, CDM Tool 30, and CDM Tool 33.

The project focuses on the distribution of improved cookstoves with enhanced thermal efficiency to reduce unsustainable fuelwood consumption and improve heat transfer efficiency compared to traditional cooking systems.\n\n**Emission Quantification Procedure:**\nThe emission quantification procedure follows a step-by-step process to accurately measure project emissions and carbon stock changes. This includes the distribution and implementation of improved cooking stoves in all districts of Timor-Leste.\n\n**Carbon Stock Changes:**\nTo quantify carbon stock changes, Equation 5 is utilized, incorporating a default discount factor of 0.99 to account for the efficiency loss of the project cookstove per year of operation. This equation enables the calculation of carbon stock changes as a result of the project activities.\n\n**Project Emissions:**\nThe project emissions may be negative when carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed project emissions. The distribution of improved cookstoves contributes to reducing emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration, resulting in a net positive impact on the environment.\n\n**Reductions and Removals:**\nThe methodology applied allows for the separate quantification of emission reductions and removals.
