The primary objective is to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable practices within the community.\n\n## Implementation Strategy\nThe project involves the widespread implementation of energy-efficient cookstoves across all districts of Timor-Leste. By reducing harmful emissions, particularly indoor air pollution, the initiative seeks to enhance economic, health, environmental, and overall quality of life for the communities involved. The distribution of jumbo stove-type ICS, boasting a thermal efficiency of 38 percent and a lifespan of seven years, forms a crucial component of the implementation strategy.\n\n## Stakeholders Engagement\nKey stakeholders in the Timor-Leste ICS Project include relevant Government Ministries and Departments, the Secretary of State of Environment, the head of Timor-Leste Designated National Authority (DNA), NGO representatives, and delegates from the nearest four sub-districts in the Dili municipality. Collaboration among these stakeholders is essential for the successful execution of the project.\n\n## Expected Impact\nThe anticipated outcomes of the project include a decrease in the consumption of unsustainably harvested fuelwood, support for the Government of Timor-Leste in mitigating carbon emissions in rural and peri-urban areas, and the gradual displacement of traditional three-stone cookstoves as communities begin to experience the benefits of using energy-efficient ICS.\n\n## Challenges and Opportunities\nDespite the recognition of improved cooking stoves as a vital mitigation measure in Timor-Leste's NDC, the project faces challenges related to the limited penetration of this technology. Overcoming this hurdle will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders to promote the adoption of ICS and drive positive change in cooking practices.\n\nIn conclusion, the Timor-Leste ICS Project is poised to make a significant impact by promoting sustainable energy solutions, reducing carbon emissions, and improving the well-being of communities. Through collaborative efforts and effective implementation, the project aims to achieve its goal of no net harm while fostering a more sustainable future for Timor-Leste."

The efficiency of the project stove is initially set at 38% and monitored annually with a default discount factor of 0.99 per year of operation. These values are determined based on methodologies such as VMR0006 on High-Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves Installation and standards like CDM Tool 30 and CDM Tool 33 for biomass calculations and default parameters.\n\n### Purpose of Data\n\nThe data on the number of improved cook stoves is crucial for monitoring and recording the stoves operating during each year, calculating emission reductions, and facilitating project implementation. Additionally, this data helps in assessing the impact of the project on participants, including their understanding of project benefits, feedback on stove usage, and the distribution of project-related material during presentation sessions.\n\nBy maintaining accurate and consistent data and parameters throughout the project crediting period, the Timor-Leste ICS Project can effectively track its progress, quantify emission reductions, and ensure the successful implementation of improved cook stoves for sustainable livelihood improvements.\n\n---\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the data and parameters available at validation for the Timor-Leste ICS Project, ensuring transparency and accountability in project implementation."

The monitoring includes tracking the number of improved cook stoves in operation and the percentage used for calculating estimated emission reductions. The data sources, measurement methods, monitoring frequencies, equipment used, QA/QC procedures, purposes of the data, calculation methods, and any additional comments are detailed for each monitored data/parameter. The information provided ensures accurate quantification of estimated reductions and removals for the project crediting period."
