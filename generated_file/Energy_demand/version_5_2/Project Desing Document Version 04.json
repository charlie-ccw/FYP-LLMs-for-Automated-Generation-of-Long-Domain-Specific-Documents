The procedure focuses on the gap between demand and supply of firewood in the region rather than national policies. When carbon stock increases exceed project emissions, project emissions should be specified as less than 300,000 tCO2e.\n\n## Methodological Choices and Justifications\nMethodological choices, such as the applicability of AMS - II.G methodology, project boundary definition, and qualifying criteria, need to be explained and justified.
