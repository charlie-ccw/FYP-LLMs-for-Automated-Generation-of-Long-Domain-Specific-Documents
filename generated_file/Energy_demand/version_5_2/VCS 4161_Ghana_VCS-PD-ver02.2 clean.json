By implementing these technologies, the project targets significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon dioxide (CO2) removals. \n\n**1. Summary Description of Technologies/Measures**\n\nThe project will focus on the deployment of improved cookstoves to replace inefficient three-stone fires and traditional stoves. The TLC-CQC Rocket Stoves offer enhanced combustion mechanisms and ventilation systems, resulting in a minimum efficiency of 25%. This upgrade in technology is crucial for optimizing energy use and reducing carbon emissions.\n\n**2. Location of the Project**\n\nSituated in Ghana, the project site is located at approximately 5.4079185 latitude and -0.9170353 longitude. This strategic positioning allows for targeted intervention in an area where traditional cooking methods are prevalent, contributing to high levels of GHG emissions.\n\n**3. Generation of GHG Emission Reductions/Carbon Dioxide Removals**\n\nThe project's primary goal is to generate GHG emission reductions by promoting the adoption of improved cookstoves. By transitioning from non-renewable wood fuel to the more efficient TLC-CQC Rocket Stoves, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to decrease significantly. This shift towards cleaner cooking technologies will lead to tangible environmental benefits.\n\n**4. Scenario Prior to the Implementation of the Project**\n\nBefore the project's initiation, the community relied on non-renewable wood fuel for cooking, utilizing inefficient three-stone fires and traditional stoves. These outdated cooking methods not only led to energy wastage but also contributed to elevated levels of GHG emissions, impacting both the environment and public health.\n\n**5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals**\n\nThe project anticipates an average annual GHG emission reduction of 1,126,602 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (t CO2e). Over the ten-year crediting period, the total reduction is projected to reach 11,266,021 t CO2e. These substantial reductions highlight the project's significant impact on mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable practices in the region.\n\nBy implementing improved cookstoves and enhancing energy efficiency, the project in Ghana is poised to make a meaningful contribution towards reducing GHG emissions and fostering a cleaner, more sustainable environment for the community."

The key equation used in this context is for calculating the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB):\n\n\\[\nfNRB = \\frac{NRB}{NRB + RB}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- NRB represents the difference between total woody biomass consumption (H) and renewable biomass (RB).\n\n### Vintage Period Calculations\n\n#### Projects Not Requiring Permanence Risk Assessment\n\n| Vintage Period           | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                      | Example: 10,000                      | Example: 10,000                  | Example: 10,000                 | Example: 20,000               |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                      |                                  |                                 |                               |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                      |                                  |                                 |                               |\n| Total                    |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                  |                                 |                               |\n\n#### Projects Requiring Permanence Risk Assessment\n\n##### i) Additional Information\n\n- Non-permanence risk rating (%): Example: 20%\n- Non-permanence risk report attached: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No\n- Long-term Average (LTA) for ARR and IFM projects with harvesting: Example: LTA value\n- LTA updated based on monitored data: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (Justification if No)\n- Expected total GHG benefit to date: Example: Total benefit\n- GHG credits issued below LTA: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (Justification if No)\n\n##### ii) Vintage Period Calculations\n\n| Vintage Period           | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                      | Example: 10,000                      | Example: 4,000                           | Example: 8,000                  | Example: 8,000                 | Example: 16,000                      |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                      |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                      |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                      |                                      |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                      |\n| Total                    |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                      |\n\nBy following the provided equations and methodology, the annual calculations for estimated reductions and removals can be accurately reproduced.
