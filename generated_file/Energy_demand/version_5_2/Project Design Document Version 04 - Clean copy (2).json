QA/QC procedures will be implemented to verify the quality and reliability of the collected data.\n\n## GHG Data Collection System\nWhile no specific line diagrams were mentioned in the extracted information, a comprehensive GHG data collection and management system will be developed to visually represent the flow of data from collection to analysis. This system will enhance the transparency and understanding of the monitoring process.\n\nIn conclusion, the monitoring plan outlined in this document ensures the systematic collection, recording, and analysis of data and parameters in accordance with the project requirements. By adhering to the established methods and procedures, the monitoring activities will contribute to the overall success of the project."
