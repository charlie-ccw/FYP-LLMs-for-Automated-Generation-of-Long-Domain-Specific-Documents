Instead, it focuses on quantifying net emission reductions achieved by the project without distinguishing baseline emissions or project emissions.\n\n### Equations and Methodological Choices\nThe methodology utilizes the CO2 emission factor for wood fuel from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, set at 112 tCO2/TJ.
