The estimated data and parameter values provided in Section 5.2 will be utilized for the calculations.\n\n### Tables for Project Crediting Period\n\n#### Projects Not Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n| Vintage Period          | Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000          | Example: 20,000           | Example: 10,000          | Example: 10,000        | Example: 10,000      | Example: 20,000    |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                             |                           |                          |                        |                      |                    |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                             |                           |                          |                        |                      |                    |\n| Total                   |                             |                           |                          |                        |                      |                    |\n\n#### Projects Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n| Vintage Period          | Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000          | Example: 20,000           | Example: 10,000          | Example: 4,000                | Example: 8,000         | Example: 8,000       | Example: 16,000           |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                             |                           |                          |                                |                        |                      |                             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                             |                           |                          |                                |                        |                      |                             |\n| Total                   |                             |                           |                          |                                |                        |                      |                             |\n\n### Additional Information for Projects Requiring Permanence Risk Assessment\n\n- **Non-Permanence Risk Rating:** Example: 20%\n- **Non-Permanence Risk Report Attached:** Yes/No\n- **Long-Term Average (LTA) for ARR and IFM Projects:** tCO2e\n- **LTA Updated Based on Monitored Data:** Yes/No (Provide Justification if No)\n- **Expected Total GHG Benefit to Date:** tCO2e\n- **GHG Credits Issued Below LTA:** Yes/No (Provide Justification if No)\n\nThis document outlines the process for quantifying GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals, including the equations and data used for calculations.

This document provides details on the methodologies for measuring, recording, storing, aggregating, collating, and reporting monitored data and parameters, along with the organizational structure, responsibilities, competencies of personnel, internal auditing, QA/QC procedures, handling non-conformances, and sampling approaches.\n\n## Methods for Measuring, Recording, Storing, and Reporting\nThe methods for measuring, recording, storing, aggregating, collating, and reporting on monitored data and parameters are detailed in section 3.20.5 of the VCS Standard V4.3. These methods encompass precise techniques for data collection and management to ensure accuracy and reliability. Additionally, procedures for calibrating monitoring equipment should be established to maintain the accuracy of measurements.\n\n## Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities\nThe organizational structure for monitoring activities should be clearly defined to allocate responsibilities and competencies effectively. Personnel carrying out monitoring activities are responsible for ensuring data and parameters are available at validation, monitoring the specified data and parameters as per the monitoring plan, and referring to relevant sections of the VCS Standard for guidance.\n\n## Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\nEstablishing robust procedures for internal auditing and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the monitoring process. These procedures ensure that data collection and reporting adhere to the highest standards and are in compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Handling Non-Conformances\nIn the event of non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan, procedures outlined in section 3.7.1 and 3.20.5 (4) of the VCS Standard V4.3 for non-AFOLU projects should be followed. Swift and appropriate actions must be taken to address any deviations from the monitoring plan.\n\n## Sampling Approaches and QA/QC Procedures\nSampling approaches used should consider target precision levels, sample sizes, sample site locations, stratification, frequency of measurement, and QA/QC procedures. These aspects are critical in ensuring the representativeness and reliability of the monitored data.\n\n## GHG Data Collection and Management System\nLine diagrams can be utilized to visually represent the GHG data collection and management system. These diagrams offer a clear overview of the data flow, monitoring points, and reporting mechanisms, enhancing the understanding of the monitoring process.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-defined Monitoring Plan is essential for effective data collection, analysis, and reporting. By implementing the outlined processes and procedures, organizations can ensure the accuracy, reliability, and compliance of their monitoring activities."
