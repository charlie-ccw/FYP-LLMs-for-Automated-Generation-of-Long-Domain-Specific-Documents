These cookstoves are measured in tonnes per device of a specific type and batch through sample surveys and measurement campaigns at representative households. The baseline survey for the project activity was conducted using a sampling approach outlined in the CDM document. Additionally, the project estimates the annual quantity of woody biomass used by the improved cookstoves.\n\nThe distribution of 50,000 Improved Cook Stoves in the rural area of Banaskantha District is expected to generate GHG emission reductions. The estimated total emission reductions are 2,350,075 tCO2e, with an annual average greenhouse gas removal of 335,725 tCO2e.\n\nPrior to the project implementation, the baseline scenario involved the target population continuing to use traditional cooking methods, which are less efficient and lead to higher GHG emissions.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Technologies/Measures:** Distribution of Improved Cookstoves\n- **Location:** Banaskantha District, Gujarat, India\n- **GHG Emission Reductions:** 2,350,075 tCO2e total; 335,725 tCO2e annual average\n- **Baseline Scenario:** Traditional cooking methods with higher GHG emissions\n\nThis project summary provides a clear understanding of the technologies implemented, project location, expected GHG emission reductions, baseline scenario, and estimated reductions for the project in a concise manner."

By focusing on reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and firewood, this initiative contributes to mitigating the environmental impact of household cooking practices.\n\n### Key Environmental Impacts:\n\n1. **Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** By promoting the use of energy-efficient ICS with a thermal efficiency greater than 25%, the project facilitates a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional cooking methods. This shift towards cleaner cooking technologies helps in lowering carbon footprints at the household level.\n\n2. **Conservation of Natural Resources:** The replacement of inefficient traditional cookstoves with ICS results in a decreased demand for firewood and fossil fuels. This leads to a reduction in deforestation rates and helps in conserving natural resources, thereby contributing to sustainable environmental practices.\n\n3. **Air Quality Improvement:** Traditional cookstoves are known to produce high levels of indoor air pollution, impacting the health of individuals and contributing to environmental degradation. By promoting the use of ICS, which produce less smoke and emissions, the project helps in improving indoor air quality and reducing the overall environmental burden.\n\n4. **Data-Driven Monitoring for Sustainable Practices:** The digital recording of ICS distribution data and ongoing operation and maintenance data collection enable efficient monitoring of the project's environmental impact. This data-driven approach ensures accountability, facilitates timely interventions in case of issues, and promotes sustainable practices in the long run.\n\n### Stakeholders' Commitment to Environmental Sustainability:\n\n- **Climate Detox Private Limited and Siddhant Energy Consultants**, as key stakeholders involved in the project, demonstrate a commitment to environmental sustainability by supporting initiatives that promote energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Their collaboration underscores the importance of corporate responsibility towards environmental conservation.\n\nIn conclusion, the ICS Phase II project not only aims to enhance cooking practices and livelihoods in rural households but also emphasizes environmental sustainability through the adoption of cleaner and more efficient cooking technologies. By addressing key environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, resource conservation, and air quality improvement, the project aligns with the broader goal of promoting eco-friendly practices and mitigating the adverse effects of traditional cooking methods on the environment."

The project, situated in India, a Non-Annex 1 country, does not have project activities mandated by any law, statute, or regulatory framework. Furthermore, the laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks governing the distribution of energy-efficient cookstoves are not systematically enforced in Non-Annex 1 countries, indicating a regulatory surplus.\n\n**Additionality Methods**\n\nThe methodology employed for demonstrating additionality utilizes the activity method. The first step involves verifying the absence of regulatory surplus, as there is no mandate in the host country for the distribution of energy-efficient cookstoves. The chosen method for demonstrating additionality entails distributing stoves at zero cost to end-users, with revenue solely generated from the sale of GHG credits.\n\nRegarding barrier analysis, specific information on the most relevant barriers and their credibility is not explicitly provided. However, the efficiency of the improved cookstoves can be estimated ex-ante using a conservative approach based on the manufacturer's specifications and considering a loss in efficiency per batch.\n\nThe activity method aligns with VCS methodology requirements and relevant parameters specified in the latest version of meth AMS II.G. Additionally, applicability criteria numbers 8 and 9 from Section 2.2 of AMS II.G, version 11.1, are applied to ensure conformity with the positive list.\n\nTo facilitate reproducibility, the methodology mandates the inclusion of all relevant data and parameters with their respective sources. The analysis requires consideration of the number of project devices in operation during a specific year, with a minimum threshold of 50,000 devices. Monitoring data must be collected directly from a representative sample at least once a year, ensuring a confidence/precision level of 95/10 for annual sampling and 95/5 for biennial sampling, as per methodology VMR0006.\n\nIn conclusion, the project's additionality assessment adheres to the prescribed methodology and tools, emphasizing transparency and rigor in demonstrating the project's environmental benefits beyond regulatory requirements."
