These ICS units are designed to improve combustion efficiency, thereby lowering fuel usage. The project will implement rigorous data collection procedures, maintain a comprehensive distribution and monitoring database, and employ advanced techniques to minimize errors. The primary objective is to calculate Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) based on the biomass saved, with all deployed ICS units included in the target population. Notably, the geographical location is not expected to significantly influence the parameters of interest.\n\n#### The location of the project.\n\nThe project will be implemented in the Republic of Ghana. The specific coordinates for the project location are 7\u00b056'47.5'' N latitude and 1\u00b001.392' W longitude. This central location ensures effective distribution and accessibility of the improved cookstoves to the target population.\n\n#### An explanation of how the project is expected to generate GHG emission reductions or removals.\n\nThe project is projected to generate significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by reducing reliance on non-renewable biomass. By introducing more efficient cookstoves, the project aims to cut down an average of 1,126,602 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (t CO2e) annually. Over a 10-year crediting period, this amounts to a total reduction of 11,266,021 t CO2e. The reduction in GHG emissions is achieved through improved combustion efficiency, which decreases the amount of biomass required for cooking.\n\n#### A brief description of the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project.\n\nPrior to the project's implementation, the target population primarily relied on non-renewable wood fuel, specifically firewood, to meet their thermal energy needs. Traditional cooking methods involved inefficient three-stone fires or conventional stoves that lacked improved combustion air supply mechanisms and flue gas ventilation systems. These traditional stoves were highly inefficient, leading to excessive biomass consumption and higher GHG emissions.\n\n#### An estimate of annual average and total GHG emission reductions and removals.\n\nThe project is anticipated to achieve an average annual reduction of 1,126,602 t CO2e. Over the entire 10-year crediting period, the total GHG emission reduction is estimated to be 11,266,021 t CO2e. These estimates highlight the significant environmental impact of the project in terms of reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices.\n\nIn summary, the project aims to address the inefficiencies of traditional cooking methods by introducing improved cookstoves in Ghana. This initiative not only enhances energy efficiency and reduces biomass consumption but also contributes to substantial GHG emission reductions, thereby supporting global efforts to combat climate change."

Leakage emissions refer to the unintended increase in greenhouse gas emissions outside the project boundary due to project activities. This section outlines the procedure for quantifying leakage emissions in accordance with the applied methodology, VMR0006: Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves v.1.1. The procedure includes relevant equations, methodological choices, and detailed steps to ensure accurate and reproducible calculations.\n\n## Applied Methodology\nThe methodology VMR0006 specifies that leakage emissions are quantified using a default value. This default value is essential for simplifying the calculation process while maintaining accuracy and consistency across different projects.\n\n### Default Value for Leakage Emissions\nThe default value for leakage emissions, as specified by the methodology, is **0.95**. This value is used directly in the calculations to estimate the leakage emissions resulting from the project activities.\n\n## Quantification Procedure\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n1. **Identify Project Emissions (PE)**:\n   - Determine the total emissions generated by the project activities within the project boundary.\n\n2. **Apply Default Leakage Factor**:\n   - Multiply the identified project emissions (PE) by the default leakage factor (0.95) to estimate the leakage emissions (LE).\n   \n   The formula is:\n   \n   \n   LE = PE \u00d7 0.95\n   \n\n### Example Calculation\nAssume the project emissions (PE) are calculated to be 1000 tCO\u2082e (tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent).\n\nUsing the default leakage factor:\n\nLE = 1000 \u00d7 0.95 = 950 tCO\u2082e\n\nThis means the leakage emissions for the project would be 950 tCO\u2082e.\n\n## Reductions and Removals Specification\nThe applied methodology does not provide specific details on how to separately quantify reductions and removals. Instead, it focuses on the net emission reductions achieved by the project. Therefore, the emphasis is on calculating the overall impact, which includes considering the leakage emissions as part of the total emissions.\n\n## Reproducing the Calculations\nTo reproduce the calculations, the following information is essential:\n- **Default Value**: The default leakage factor of 0.95.\n- **Reference Methodology**: VMR0006, version 1.1, specifically section 8.3, and Section 5.4 of AMS-II.G.\n- **Project Emissions (PE)**: The total emissions generated by the project activities.\n\nBy using the default value and the provided formula, one can accurately estimate the leakage emissions for any given set of project emissions.\n\n## Methodological Choices\nThe selection of the default leakage factor (0.95) is based on the guidelines provided in methodology VMR0006, version 1.1, and Section 5.4 of AMS-II.G. This choice simplifies the calculation process and ensures consistency across projects. The default value is derived from empirical data and expert judgment, providing a standardized approach to quantifying leakage emissions.\n\n### Justification\n- **Consistency**: Using a default value ensures that all projects apply a uniform standard for leakage emissions, facilitating comparability and transparency.\n- **Simplicity**: The default value approach reduces the complexity of calculations, making it easier for project developers to comply with the methodology requirements.\n- **Accuracy**: The default value is based on extensive research and reflects typical leakage rates observed in similar projects, ensuring that the estimations are realistic and reliable.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe procedure for quantifying leakage emissions involves applying a default leakage factor to the total project emissions. By following the specified methodology and using the provided equations, one can accurately estimate the leakage emissions, ensuring that the overall environmental impact of the project is comprehensively assessed. All calculations should be documented in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for transparency and verification purposes."
