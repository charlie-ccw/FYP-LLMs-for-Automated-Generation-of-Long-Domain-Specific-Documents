In the absence of the project activity, the population would persist in using traditional cookstoves, such as three-stone fires or conventional systems, which lack improved combustion air supply mechanisms and flue gas ventilation systems.\n\n### Steps in the Procedure\n\n#### Step 1: Initial Sampling\nThe initial step involves sampling a portion of the target population to achieve the required reliability level. If the initial sampling does not meet the reliability criteria, an additional 10% of premises are visited, increasing the sample size to 20% of the 30% buffer.\n\n#### Step 2: Additional Sampling\nIf the reliability level is still not achieved after Step 1, the final 10% of the additional sampling buffer is utilized, bringing the total to 30%. This ensures that the sample is sufficiently representative of the broader project population.\n\n### Application and Outcome of Each Step\nThe project employs the VCS approved methodology VMR0006 for the installation of high-efficiency firewood cookstoves, Version 1.1. The project activity must meet all applicability conditions outlined in the methodology. Specifically, the project is considered additional if it installs or distributes stoves at zero cost to the end-user and has no other source of revenue other than the sale of GHG credits.\n\n### Key Assumptions\n\n1. **Cooking on Project Stoves**: It is assumed that all meals will be cooked using the project stoves.\n2. **Representative Sampling**: The sampling method aims to adequately represent the broader project population by using a 90 percent confidence level and a 10 percent margin of error.\n3. **Field Data Verification**: Information is cross-checked with factual evidence in the field to ensure accurate data for emission reductions calculations.\n\n### Rationale Behind Key Assumptions\n\n- **High Confidence Level and Low Margin of Error**: These parameters are chosen to ensure representative and accurate data collection, minimizing sampling error.\n- **Field Data Cross-Checking**: This practice helps maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data used for calculating emission reductions.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\n1. **Addressing Non-Sampling Errors**: Measures are taken to mitigate non-response or interviewer bias, including good questionnaire design and well-tested questionnaires.\n2. **Random Household Selection**: If a household refuses to participate, another is randomly selected to maintain sample integrity.\n3. **Sample Size Calculation**: Sample size is calculated based on estimates for parameter proportions, values, and standard deviations, allowing for non-response and potential outliers.\n4. **Cost and Logistics Considerations**: Measures are chosen based on their cost-effectiveness and logistical feasibility.\n5. **Weighing Scales for Fuel Wood Measurement**: Accurate measurement of fuel wood usage is ensured by using weighing scales.\n\n### Justification for Methodological Choices\n\n- **Monitoring Plan**: The plan outlines strategies to survey households effectively, preventing interviewer bias.\n- **Sample Size Calculation**: This is based on estimates from previous studies or a preliminary sample, ensuring adequate representation.\n- **Confidence Level and Margin of Error**: A 90 percent confidence level and a 10 percent margin of error are used to ensure the sample is representative and minimizes sampling error.\n\n### Relevant References\n\n- **Approved Standardized Baselines**\n- **Published Literature/Research Papers**: Sources from reputable organizations such as FAO and UN.\n- **Government Data and Survey Results**\n- **IPCC Good Practice Guidelines**\n- **Global Forest Resources Assessment**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe baseline scenario and methodological approach are designed to ensure that the data collected is representative, accurate, and reliable. By following the outlined steps and justifying the key assumptions and methodological choices, the project can effectively demonstrate its additionality and the impact of the high-efficiency firewood cookstoves on reducing GHG emissions."

This methodology utilizes a net to gross adjustment factor to account for leakages. The procedure involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Application of Adjustment Factor**: \n   - The methodology prescribes a net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to account for leakage emissions. This factor is uniformly applied across all relevant calculations.\n\n2. **No Survey Requirement**: \n   - The methodology does not necessitate surveys to determine leakage. The default leakage factor of 0.95 is considered adequate for this purpose.\n\n### Reductions and Removals\n\nWhile the methodology does not provide explicit instructions on separating reductions and removals, it should be consulted for any specific procedures or equations.

These are applied to ensure distinct quantification of each component.\n\n### Summary Tables for Projects\n\n#### For Projects Not Required to Assess Permanence Risk\nComplete the table below for the project crediting period:\n\n| Vintage Period         | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000                    | Example: 20,000                     | Example: 10,000                     | Example: 10,000                 | Example: 10,000               | Example: 20,000             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                    |                                     |                                     |                                 |                               |                             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                    |                                     |                                     |                                 |                               |                             |\n| Total                  |                                       |                                     |                                     |                                 |                               |                             |\n\n#### For Projects Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n##### Non-Permanence Risk Assessment\n- **Non-Permanence Risk Rating (%):** Example: 20%\n- **Non-Permanence Risk Report Attached:** \u2610 Yes \u2610 No\n- **Long-Term Average (LTA) in tCO2e:** [Specify Value]\n- **LTA Updated Based on Monitored Data:** \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n- **Expected Total GHG Benefit to Date in tCO2e:** [Specify Value]\n- **GHG Credits Issued Below LTA:** \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n\n##### Summary Table for Project Crediting Period\nComplete the table below for the project crediting period:\n\n| Vintage Period         | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000                    | Example: 20,000                     | Example: 10,000                     | Example: 4,000                          | Example: 8,000                  | Example: 8,000                 | Example: 16,000                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                    |                                     |                                     |                                         |                                 |                               |                                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                    |                                     |                                     |                                         |                                 |                               |                                     |\n| Total                  |                                       |                                     |                                     |                                         |                                 |                               |                                     |\n\n### Conclusion\nThis document provides a comprehensive guide for quantifying GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals.
