The change in carbon stock is calculated as the difference between these measurements.\n\n### Reductions and Removals\n\nWhile explicit procedures are not outlined, the general approach involves calculating reductions in GHG emissions compared to the baseline scenario and increases in carbon sequestration due to project activities.\n\n### Relevant Equations\n\nKey equations for quantifying baseline emissions and carbon stock changes are typically based on emission factors and activity data. These equations, including those for baseline emissions, project emissions, and net GHG emission reductions, ensure accurate and comprehensive calculations.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nThe selection of emission factors and default values is crucial and should be clearly justified. For example, adjusting for leakage with a net-to-gross factor of 0.95 ensures conservative estimates of net GHG emission reductions and removals.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nTo enhance transparency and verification, all calculations should be compiled in a dedicated spreadsheet. This spreadsheet should include emission reduction and removal calculations, allowing for independent review of the results.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAccurately quantifying baseline emissions and carbon stock changes is essential for evaluating a project's impact on GHG emissions.

This section presents a detailed procedure for quantifying leakage emissions, focusing on the application of a default net to gross adjustment factor. By following the outlined methodology and equations, the process ensures the precise calculation of net emission reductions.\n\n### Utilization of Default Adjustment Factor\n\nIn compliance with the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G, Version 11.0, a default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is employed to address leakage emissions. This adjustment factor streamlines the process by converting gross emission reductions into net emission reductions, effectively considering potential leakage without the need for additional surveys or specialized management strategies.\n\n### Breakdown of Emissions\n\nThe methodology distinguishes between baseline emissions, project emissions, and leakage emissions, providing a comprehensive analysis of each component.
