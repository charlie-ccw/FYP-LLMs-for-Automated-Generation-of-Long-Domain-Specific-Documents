It serves as a benchmark for measuring the project's effectiveness. This section identifies and justifies the baseline scenario according to the applied methodology and relevant tools. We will elucidate key assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices, providing pertinent references.\n\n### Procedure in Applied Methodology\n\n#### Step 1: Describing the Pre-Project Scenario\nPrior to the project's implementation, the target population relies predominantly on non-renewable wood fuel for their thermal energy needs, such as cooking and heating. This wood fuel is typically sourced from local forests, contributing to deforestation and elevated GHG emissions due to inefficient combustion.\n\n#### Step 2: Identifying the Baseline Scenario\nThe baseline scenario is defined as the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population. This scenario is crucial as it represents the situation that would persist without the project activity. The reliance on non-renewable wood fuel is environmentally unsustainable and poses health risks due to indoor air pollution.\n\n#### Step 3: Estimating GHG Emission Reductions\nTo estimate the annual average and total GHG emission reductions, we compare emissions from the baseline scenario with those from the project scenario, where efficient cookstoves are introduced. This involves calculating the amount of wood fuel saved and the corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions.\n\n### Key Assumptions and Rationale\n\n1. **Geographic and Demographic Consistency**: The baseline scenario is based on the project description, specifying that all new project activities will occur within Thailand. This ensures geographic and demographic consistency in the assessment.\n\n2. **Continued Use of Non-Renewable Wood Fuel**: It is assumed that, in the absence of the project, the target population would continue using non-renewable wood fuel. This assumption is based on historical data and current trends in the region's fuel usage.\n\n3. **Thermal Energy Needs**: The thermal energy needs of the target population remain constant in both the baseline and project scenarios, allowing for a direct comparison of fuel consumption and GHG emissions.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nThe choice to focus on the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel is justified by its prevalence and significant environmental impact within the target population. The methodology involves:\n\n- **Data Collection**: Gathering data on current wood fuel consumption and GHG emissions.\n- **Emission Factors**: Applying standard emission factors for non-renewable wood fuel combustion.\n- **Efficiency Gains**: Estimating efficiency gains from introducing project cookstoves and the resultant reduction in wood fuel consumption.\n\n### Justification and References\n\nThe baseline scenario is supported by the project description, which outlines the methodology's applicability, project boundary, and baseline scenario. The continued use of non-renewable wood fuel is well-documented in the project area, providing a reliable benchmark for assessing the project's impact. Relevant references include:\n\n- **Project Documentation**: Detailed project descriptions and feasibility studies.\n- **Emission Factors**: Standardized emission factors from recognized environmental agencies.\n- **Historical Data**: Historical data on wood fuel usage and deforestation rates in Thailand.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the baseline scenario of continued use of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population is justified and well-supported by the applied methodology and relevant data. This scenario provides a clear benchmark for measuring the project's effectiveness in reducing GHG emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices."
