These stoves, fueled by biomass such as wood and agricultural residues, resulted in higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to their inefficiency.\n\n#### Project Implementation and GHG Emissions\nIt is important to note that the project was not initiated to deliberately generate GHG emissions for subsequent reduction. Instead, the project aims to reduce existing emissions by introducing improved cook stoves designed for enhanced efficiency, thereby decreasing fuel consumption and associated GHG emissions. The quantified reduction in GHG emissions is meticulously documented over multiple years to demonstrate the project's environmental benefits.\n\n#### Baseline Scenario\nThe baseline scenario represents the continuation of pre-existing conditions in the absence of the project. As the pre-project conditions involved the use of traditional cook stoves, the baseline scenario aligns with these conditions. For a detailed overview of the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn essence, prior to project initiation, end users heavily relied on traditional cook stoves, contributing to elevated GHG emissions. The project's objective was not to produce GHG emissions for reduction purposes but to mitigate existing emissions through the adoption of improved cook stoves. As the baseline scenario mirrors pre-project conditions, further elaboration can be found in Section 3.4."

It encompasses the requisite steps, formulas, and methodological decisions to ensure precise and replicable computations of leakage emissions. The quantification process is bifurcated into reductions and removals, with distinct procedures and formulas elucidated for each.\n\n### 1. Procedure for Quantification of Leakage Emissions\nQuantifying leakage emissions involves adjusting the baseline fuel wood consumption to accommodate leakages. This adjustment is executed by employing a net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95. The sequential steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Determine Baseline Fuel Wood Consumption**: Ascertain the quantity of fuel wood consumed in the baseline scenario.\n2. **Apply Adjustment Factor**: Multiply the baseline fuel wood consumption by the net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to factor in leakages.\n\n### 2. Reductions and Removals\nThe methodology distinguishes between reductions and removals by addressing baseline emissions, project emissions, and net GHG emission reductions or removals. The calculation of emission reductions is governed by the following equation:\n\n\\[ ER_y = B_{y,savings} \\times fNRB_y \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ER_y \\) = Emission reductions during year \\( y \\) (tCO2e)\n- \\( B_{y,savings} \\) = Annual biomass savings (tonnes)\n- \\( fNRB_y \\) = Fraction of non-renewable biomass\n- \\( NCV_{biomass} \\) = Net Calorific Value of the biomass (TJ/tonne)\n- \\( EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\) = Emission factor for the projected fossil fuel (tCO2e/TJ)\n\n### 3.
