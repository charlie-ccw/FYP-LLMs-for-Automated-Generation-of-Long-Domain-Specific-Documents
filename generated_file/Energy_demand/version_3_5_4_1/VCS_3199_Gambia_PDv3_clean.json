These procedures are essential for maintaining data integrity.\n\n## Handling Non-conformances with Validated Monitoring Plan\n\nIn the event of non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan, procedures are in place to address issues promptly. Field personnel are required to review, understand, and adhere to the monitoring plan procedures. Documentation of out-of-population cases, refusals, and other non-response sources is mandatory. A quality control and assurance strategy is documented to maintain the plan's integrity.\n\n## Sampling Approaches and Procedures\n\nSimple Random Sampling is employed for monitored parameters, with sample sizes determined to achieve a 90/10 confidence/precision level. Sampling sites serve as primary sampling units, with monitoring conducted at least once every two years. Quality assurance and quality control procedures are integrated into the sampling approach to ensure data accuracy and reliability.\n\n## GHG Data Collection and Management System\n\nA line diagram illustrating the GHG data collection and management system will be included to provide a visual representation of the processes involved in monitoring, recording, and analyzing data related to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBy adhering to the Monitoring Plan and following the outlined procedures, the project will maintain transparency, accuracy, and reliability in monitoring its environmental impact."
