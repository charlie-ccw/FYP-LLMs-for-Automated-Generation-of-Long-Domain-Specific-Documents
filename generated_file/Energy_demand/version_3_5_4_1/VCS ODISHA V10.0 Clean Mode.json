By distributing and installing these energy-efficient stoves, the project aims to reduce particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions, minimize household air pollution, and enhance the overall efficiency of cooking processes. The core technology utilized in this initiative is the deployment of ICS, designed to optimize fuel consumption and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with cooking activities. Initially located in Odisha and Jharkhand, India, the project plans to expand to other regions in the future. Through the adoption of ICS, significant reductions in GHG emissions are expected, contributing to a cleaner environment. Prior to the project, households likely relied on traditional cooking methods that contribute to air pollution and GHG emissions. The project estimates substantial annual average GHG emission reductions of 2,48,379 tCO2e and total reductions and removals of 17,38,650 tCO2e, highlighting the positive impact of transitioning to ICS. By promoting sustainable cooking practices, the project aims to create healthier living conditions for households and support global climate change mitigation efforts."

This strategic endeavor aims to diminish the dependence on non-renewable biomass for cooking purposes, facilitate access to contemporary energy services, generate employment prospects, and align with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1. By introducing these Improved Cooking Stoves, the project anticipates substantial sustainable development impacts. The primary outcome encompasses a notable decline in fuelwood consumption for cooking, resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This GHG reduction not only aids in combating climate change but also eases the strain on forest ecosystems, thus supporting SDG objectives related to carbon emissions reduction and forest preservation. Moreover, the project harmonizes with the country's articulated sustainable development priorities by disseminating one million energy-efficient cookstoves throughout Odisha. This dissemination of clean energy solutions extends clean cooking facilities to rural and peri-urban communities, culminating in tangible reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. To ensure robust monitoring of these reductions, the project has instituted a monitoring scheme overseen by CoreCarbonX, which will supervise and report on the strides taken to curtail GHG emissions. Beyond environmental advantages, the project also contributes to various Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). By furnishing access to vital clean energy services and fostering job opportunities across six states in India, the project not only addresses immediate energy requisites but also nurtures sustainable development in its operational regions. In essence, the project's deployment of energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves in rural settings not only advocates for sustainable energy practices but also aligns with national sustainable development imperatives and bolsters the attainment of multiple Sustainable Development Goals.
