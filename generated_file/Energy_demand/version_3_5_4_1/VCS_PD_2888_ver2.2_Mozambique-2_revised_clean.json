The emissions from this activity contribute to the release of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. The inclusion of these gases in the baseline scenario is justified by the prevalent practice of using traditional stoves that burn firewood inefficiently, leading to significant GHG emissions. Other GHGs may also be emitted as byproducts of this process.\n\n**Project Scenario:**\nIn contrast, the project scenario aims to reduce emissions by implementing high-efficiency stoves that utilize woody biomass more sustainably. The key GHG sources in the project scenario include CO2, CH4, and N2O, with the primary focus on mitigating emissions from the combustion of biomass for cooking purposes. The justification for including these gases lies in the transition from traditional, inefficient cooking methods to modern, cleaner technologies that promote sustainable energy practices. Other GHGs may also be considered based on the specific characteristics of the project.\n\n**Diagram of Project Boundary:**\nThe diagram below illustrates the project boundary for the implementation of high-efficiency stoves using woody biomass in Mozambique-2. It highlights the physical locations of installations and management activities integral to the project, showcasing the equipment, systems, and flows of mass and energy involved.
