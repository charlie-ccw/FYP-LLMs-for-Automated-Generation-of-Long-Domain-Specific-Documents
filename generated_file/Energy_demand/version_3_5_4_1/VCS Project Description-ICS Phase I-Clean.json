These ICS units are designed with high thermal efficiency to significantly reduce fuel wood consumption and, consequently, lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Implemented Technologies/Measures\n\nThe central technology employed in this initiative is the deployment of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS). These stoves are engineered to maximize thermal efficiency, leading to decreased fuel wood usage and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Project Location\n\nThe project is located in the Sabarkantha and Patan districts within the state of Gujarat, India. These rural areas are the focal points for the introduction of these fuel-efficient cookstoves.\n\n### Expected Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions\n\nThrough the distribution and promotion of Improved Cook Stoves in rural areas, the project aims to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The enhanced thermal efficiency of the ICS units will directly contribute to mitigating emissions linked to traditional cooking methods.\n\n### Pre-Project Scenario\n\nBefore the project's commencement, the rural communities in Sabarkantha and Patan districts mainly used traditional mud or three-stone cookstoves for cooking. These conventional stoves are notorious for their inefficient fuel consumption and higher emissions.\n\n### Reduction and Removal Estimates\n\nThe project targets an annual average reduction of 335,725 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). Over the project's lifespan, it aims to achieve a total of 2,350,075 tCO2e reductions and removals, demonstrating a substantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the region.\n\nBy emphasizing the adoption of Improved Cook Stoves and advocating for sustainable cooking practices, this project is positioned to make a tangible contribution to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing environmental sustainability in rural Gujarat."
