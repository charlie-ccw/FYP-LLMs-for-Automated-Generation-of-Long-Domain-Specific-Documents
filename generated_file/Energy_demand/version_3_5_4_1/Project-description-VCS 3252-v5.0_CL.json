        "generation": "The project's primary objective is the widespread distribution of fuel-efficient improved cookstoves (ICS) in India. These high thermal efficient ICS are intended to replace the less efficient baseline cookstoves currently in use. By enhancing the burning efficiency of wood, the ICS will facilitate better thermal energy transfer to cooking pots, leading to fuel wood savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative not only addresses deforestation but also mitigates health risks associated with indoor air pollution. Moreover, it alleviates the burden on women and children who would otherwise spend significant time collecting firewood. To ensure accessibility, the project provides these ICS free of charge to the target population. Users are informed in advance that the utilization of ICS generates carbon finance, which is utilized to cover the costs of the stoves and project implementation. The project's initial activities are concentrated in the Assam state of India, with potential expansion to other regions detailed in Section 1.12. The ICS will replace the prevalent practice of cooking over an open fire, offering a more sustainable solution. The project anticipates an average annual GHG emission reduction of 6,956 tCO2e per year for the estimated 1,000 project instances, and a total reduction of 48,689 tCO2e over the project's duration. EKI Energy Services Limited will centrally manage the implementation, GHG accounting, and monitoring of this initiative. By promoting the adoption of these efficient cookstoves, the project not only enhances energy efficiency but also significantly contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fostering a sustainable and environmentally conscious cooking approach in India."

The project stove shall have a specified high-power thermal efficiency of at least 25% per the manufacturer\u2019s specifications and shall exclusively use woody biomass and can be single pot or multi-pot | Energy-efficient stoves planned to be installed under this project are single pot portable cookstoves that have an efficiency of more than 25%. For all project activity instances, ICS with an efficiency of 36.42% is planned to be installed. For future project activity instances, the manufacturer may change, and that cookstove efficiency should be more than 25% as mentioned in the methodology based on the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nBoth \u2018Projects\u2019 and \u2018Large Projects\u2019 can use the methodology | Estimated average annual emission reductions for the grouped project activity are less than 300,000 tonnes CO2e per year. Therefore, the proposed project qualifies the \u2018Projects\u2019 criteria.\n\nNon-renewable biomass has been used since 31-December-1989 in India as demonstrated below by referring to published literature, official reports, or statistics.\n\nFor the specific case of biomass residues processed as fuel (e.g., briquettes, wood chips), it shall be demonstrated that:\n  a. It is produced using exclusively renewable biomass (more than one type of biomass may be used)\n  b. The consumption of the fuel should be monitored during the crediting period\n  c.

The ICS is introduced as an energy efficiency measure to replace baseline stoves and reduce the use of non-renewable biomass for combustion.\n\nThe VCS PD shall explain the proposed method for the distribution of project devices, including the method to avoid double counting of emission reductions, such as unique identifications of the product and end-user locations (e.g., program logo) | Each ICS in this project will be identified by a unique combination of customer name and geographical location, as well as a serial number. The serial number will be a unique number that will allow for a clear distinction between the stoves. No individual serial number can be repeated within the project, ensuring that each stove is counted only once in the proposed project. In addition, the project has been cross-checked against other CDM/VCS/GS4GG project activities operating in the country using the UNFCCC, VERRA, the Gold Standard, and other relevant voluntary carbon schemes to ensure that the ICS is not included in any other CDM project activity or voluntary project activity.\n\nThe VCS PD shall also explain how the proposed procedures prevent double counting of emission reductions, for example, to avoid that project stove manufacturers, wholesale providers, or others claim credit for emission reductions from the project devices. The above criteria are as per the VCS meth requirement and para 8 of the latest version of meth AMS II.G version 12 is followed. (Additionally, applicability criteria numbers 8 and 9 set out in Section 2.2 of AMS II.G, version 11.1 shall apply) | Manufacturers/cookstove distributors undertaking will be provided that EKI will be the owner of that carbon credits, and Manufacturers/cookstove distributors will not claim any credits for such cookstoves.\n\nProject participants are able to show that non-renewable biomass has been used since 31-December-1989, using survey methods or referring to published literature, official reports, or statistics. | Justification: Use of non-renewable biomass is established through the demonstration of the gap between the demand for firewood and silviculturally permissible production of biomass from forests and trees outside the forest."

        "generation": "# Monitoring Plan\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the monitoring plan designed to capture, record, analyze, and report on the specified data and parameters as outlined in Section 5.2 (Data and Parameters Monitored). The plan encompasses methodologies for data measurement, storage, aggregation, collation, and reporting, along with procedures for internal auditing, quality assurance, and addressing non-conformances.\n\n## Data Measurement and Recording Methods\n\n- **Measurement Techniques:** Transparent data collection methods will be employed to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n- **Data Storage:** Monitored data will be securely stored electronically for a minimum of two years.\n- **Calibration Protocols:** Monitoring equipment will undergo regular calibration following established guidelines.\n- **Aggregation and Collation:** Data will be meticulously aggregated and collated to maintain precision and completeness.\n- **Reporting Procedures:** Timely reporting on monitored data and parameters will adhere to the designated schedule.\n\n## Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities\n\n- **Organizational Setup:** EKI Energy Services Ltd. (EKIESL) will oversee monitoring activities, with clear delineation of responsibilities among personnel.\n- **Staff Competencies:** Monitoring personnel will possess requisite competencies and undergo necessary training.\n- **Assigned Roles:** Responsibilities will encompass data collection, validation, and reporting.\n- **Skill Development:** Personnel will receive training to uphold accurate and reliable monitoring practices.\n\n## Internal Auditing and Quality Assurance\n\n- **Internal Audits:** Regular internal audits will be conducted to verify data accuracy and ensure adherence to monitoring protocols.\n- **Quality Assurance:** Quality control measures will include oversampling, outlier identification, and data quality assessments.\n- **Training Initiatives:** Ongoing training will be provided to maintain high data collection and reporting standards.\n\n## Addressing Non-Conformances\n\n- **Corrective Actions:** Non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan will be promptly rectified through revision of monitoring procedures.\n- **Approval Process:** Any modifications to the monitoring plan will require approval from a designated verifier, such as the Designated Operational Entity.\n- **Continuous Enhancement:** Lessons learned from non-conformances will drive improvements in monitoring processes to prevent future issues.\n\n## Sampling Approaches and Data Management\n\n- **Sampling Strategies:** Sampling methodologies will be tailored based on precision targets, sample sizes, site characteristics, and measurement frequency.\n- **QA/QC Protocols:** Robust quality assurance and quality control procedures will be implemented to ensure the integrity and accuracy of sampled data.\n- **Visual Representation:** Line diagrams will be utilized to visually depict the GHG data collection and management system, enhancing comprehension and transparency.\n\nBy adhering to this monitoring plan, we aim to ensure the precise and dependable collection, recording, and analysis of data and parameters to bolster our environmental monitoring endeavors effectively."
