        "section_name": "Monitoring Plan",
        "generation": "# Monitoring Plan\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe monitoring plan is based on the applied methodology VMR0006, Version V1.1. Simultaneous/Parallel use of baseline biomass stove along with project ICS: The project uses equation 4 of the methodology to determine emission reductions from the project activity. As per the applied methodology, the monitoring parameter BEy=1,new,i,survey is to be monitored only in the first year of project crediting period and shall get fixed thereafter. Also, according to the project design, the sampling based measurement campaign/monitoring survey to determine BEy=1,new,i,survey, shall only be conducted in households with no baseline stove usage. Hence, the following conservative approach shall be adopted to ensure that BEy=1,new,i,survey, is adjusted / corrected on account of parallel/continued use of baseline stoved along with project stove, during the crediting period. Where the project households continue to use baseline cookstoves along with project ICS, BEy=1,new,i,survey shall be adjusted ex-post, based on the percentage of project households found to continue such practice. For such cases, BEy=1,new,i,survey due to implementation of ICS shall be adjusted to account for extent of ex-post use of baseline stoves in addition to project ICS. BEy=1,new,i,survey(adjusted) = BEy=1,new,i,survey * CFbaseline stove Where: CFbaseline stove = Correction factor to account for continued/parallel use of baseline stoves. The ex-post usage surveys shall also check presence and parallel usage of baseline stoves along with project ICS. In case the baseline stove is found decommissioned and no longer used for a given sampled user, CFbaseline stove shall be considered as 1.0 days for the sample. In case the baseline devices are found in use otherwise for a sample, the monitoring surveys shall capture cooking frequency and stove usage of sampled household, by asking questions and/or collecting evidences to determine the frequency of usage of both the baseline devices and project ICS. Fuel consumption by baseline stoves may be determined based on ratio of number of meals cooked over baseline stoves Vs that on project ICS during a day/week/month to determine the ratio of baseline stove usage Vs project ICS. In case a sample does not report data on relative usage of baseline stove vs project ICS (number of meals on each stove), a CFbaseline stove of 0.5 shall be taken. The average CFbaseline stove over the sampled households shall be used to adjust BEy=1,new,i,survey(adjusted). Sampling plan Due to the large number of ICS envisioned to be distributed as part of the project activity, it is not economically feasible to monitor each individual ICS unit distributed. Therefore, representative sampling will be undertaken as part of a cross-PA Sampling Plan in line with the requirements of the methodology applied and the Standard: Sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programmes of activities, version 9.0. Sample sizes will be sufficient to ensure that the precision of the sample means/proportions are in accordance with the methodological / standard requirements. In cases where survey results indicate that desired precision is not achieved, the lower bound value of the corresponding confidence interval of the parameter value may be used as an alternative to repeating the survey. Alternatively, the survey may be expanded to reach the required confidence/precision, unless option (b) on page 12 of the VMR0006 is used. The sampling methodology will be in accordance with the representative sampling methods provided by the sampling guidelines and standards as indicated along this section, with the applied methodology having precedence. Sampling Methodology Sampling Objective \u2013 The sampling objective for each parameter is to determine, via sampling survey, a statistically significant parameter value for the emission reduction calculations. These parameters are as listed in section 5.2: 1. Monitoring Parameters: Ny,i,j; Sampling Parameters: Proportion of operational ICS; Parameter type: Proportion; Monitoring frequency: Biennially 2. Monitoring Parameters: BEy=1,new,i,survey; Sampling Parameters: Quantity of woody biomass used by project devices; Parameter type: Mean; Monitoring frequency: First year of project implementation and fixed thereafter for entire crediting period Field Measurement Objective and data to be collected \u2013 As listed in Section 5.2 above Target population and sampling frame \u2013 The target population is the total population served under the grouped project, and the sampling frame consists of aggregated data of end-users of the ICS as recorded in the PA Databases. The sampling frame will be kept for 2 years following the crediting period or the last issuance of the CERs of the project activity. Sample method \u2013 Sampling will be conducted using stratified random sampling techniques over the sampling frame, and detailed calculations are provided below as per CDM guidelines \u201cSampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programmes of activities\u201d the ICS in the sampling frame shall be stratified as per parameters requirements. Stratified Random Sampling will be used to select samples from the Project Database for monitoring parameters. The sample size shall be determined using the following formula: n \u2265 (z2 * N * V) / ((N \u2013 1) * precision2 + z2 * V) Where, n = number of ICS to be sampled N = Total number of ICS in the population Z = Constant referring to level of confidence (1.96 for 95 %, 1.646 for 90%) Precision = Required precision (e.g., 10% = 0.1) Where for proportion-based parameters: V = SD2 / p2 SD2 = (\u2211 gi * pi * (1 \u2013 pi)) / N p = (\u2211 gi * pi) / N Where, SD2 = Weighted Overall Standard deviation gi = weight of strata i in the population pi = expected proportion of strata i in the population k = total number of strata in the population And for mean-based parameters: V = SD2 / mean2 SD2 = (\u2211 gi * SDi2) / N mean = (\u2211 gi * mi) / N Where, Mean = weighted overall mean mi = Mean of strata i Optionally, other sampling approaches may be used in accordance with Standard \u201cSampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programmes of activities\u201d and Guideline for Sampling and Surveys for CDM Project Activities and Programme of Activities when sampling techniques or statistical analysis necessitates it. To ensure a random stratified sample selection, random number generators shall be applied. Each ICS in the target population is uniquely identifiable by its Serial ID number. Each ICS can thus be allocated a Sample Selection Number in each monitoring period, starting at 1 and increasing up to the total number of ICS in the Database for that pre-defined stratified sampling frame. Applying the random number generators, the ICS can then be randomly chosen from the defined population up to the required sample size as calculated by the CME. In the case of parameters monitored for the first time the expected variation for that measure in the sample may be based on results from similar studies, pilot studies, or from the project planner\u2019s own knowledge / experience of the data. The data will be collected using surveys carried out either by external third parties or by project implementer teams. Data collected from the surveys will be compiled into an Excel spreadsheet. Data obtained from the samples will be used to estimate proportions and mean values for the parameters described above. The values will then be factored into the emissions reduction calculations. During sampling, there may be non-response from the target population. Over-sampling may be used to avoid non-response; however, sampling may be ceased once required confidence/precision is met. Alternatively, a simplified approach proposed in option (b) under Section 8.4 of methodology may be used for determining the minimum sample size for usage survey in which case compliance with required confidence/precision is not obligatory. The minimum sample size for project cookstove to conduct the usage survey should be: 1. Project target population < 300: Minimum sample size 30 2. Project target population 300 to 1000: Minimum sample size 10% of group size 3. Project target population > 1000: Minimum sample size 100 The PP may not do cross-PA sampling and rather conduct separate sampling and monitoring for each PA. In such a case, the approach defined above shall be applied to each PA, albeit with 90/10 confidence / precision levels for annual sampling and 95/10 for biennial sampling (instead of 95/10 for annual/biennial sampling for cross-PA sampling). Similarly, for fuel measurement campaigns, sample sizes may be alternatively determined as per the available KPT protocols.
