        "generation": "## Baseline Scenario Overview\n\n### Baseline Scenario Explanation\n\nThe baseline scenario entails the distribution of improved cookstoves to users heavily reliant on traditional cookstoves and foraged fuelwood without essential features like combustion air supply, flue gas ventilation, chimney, or grate. Selection criteria exclude those with flue gas ventilation systems or grates. Verification of existing cookstoves and fuel usage precedes the distribution of improved cookstoves, ensuring compliance through an end-user agreement. All beneficiaries selected for the project rely on non-renewable wood fuel in traditional cookstoves to meet thermal energy needs, forming the baseline scenario.\n\nFor this project, the baseline cookstove is the traditional three-stone cookstove or a conventional device lacking improved combustion air supply, flue gas ventilation, grate, or chimney, with an assumed efficiency of 10%. The pre-project scenario involves the realistic use of traditional mud cookstoves for cooking and water boiling, reflecting the prevalent reliance on solid cooking fuels like firewood, crop residue, cow dung cake, and coal/lignite/charcoal in rural and impoverished urban settings.\n\nA baseline survey conducted in Meghalaya underscores the widespread inefficient cooking practices in rural areas, with households using dung cakes and kerosene facing elevated risks of acute respiratory infections. The survey highlights the health hazards associated with household air pollution, emphasizing the urgent need for improved cooking technologies and energy sources in India, especially in rural regions.\n\nNational statistics from the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) reveal the significant proportion of the Indian population using solid fuels, leading to air pollution-related deaths. The project aims to reduce emissions by promoting cleaner cookstoves, mitigating the adverse health effects linked to traditional biomass use. Notably, the voluntary nature of the project activity aligns with the absence of a legal mandate for fuel-efficient stoves in India.\n\nThe prevalent use of traditional 3-stone chulhas or inefficient wood/charcoal stoves is attributed to factors like illegal logging, lack of awareness regarding fuel wastage, and the capital costs of efficient technologies. Baseline surveys in Madhya Pradesh confirm the reliance on traditional cookstoves with firewood as the primary fuel source, a trend likely mirrored in other states pending further survey results."
