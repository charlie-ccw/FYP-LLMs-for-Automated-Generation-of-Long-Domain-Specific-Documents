This section delineates these deviations, justifies their application, and presents evidence to affirm that they do not compromise the conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification. Additionally, it confirms that these deviations are confined solely to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement.\n\n### Deviation 1: Confidence Interval Adjustment\n\n**Description:**\nWe have chosen to utilize the lower bound of the 90% or 95% confidence interval of the parameter value as an alternative when the required 90/10 or 95/10 precision is not achieved during sampling.\n\n**Justification:**\nThis deviation ensures that even when the precision criteria are unmet, the data remains robust and reliable. By employing the lower bound of the confidence interval, we maintain a conservative estimate, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- The implementation of a single sampling plan covering a grouped project with 95/10 confidence/precision for the sample size calculation ensures that the deviation does not adversely affect the conservativeness of the quantification.\n- This approach aligns with the standard sampling and survey requirements for CDM project activities and programs, ensuring compliance and reliability.\n- Representative sampling will be conducted in accordance with the applied methodology\u2019s requirements to accurately monitor relevant parameters.\n\n### Deviation 2: Sample Size Margin Adjustment\n\n**Description:**\nWe have applied a 10% margin over the determined sample size to address potential low response rates and answer biases during surveys.\n\n**Justification:**\nAnticipating a possible low response rate and answer bias, this deviation ensures that the sample remains representative and sufficient for accurate data analysis. This proactive measure helps mitigate the risk of data insufficiency or skewed results, thereby maintaining the reliability and conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- The 10% margin ensures that the sample size remains adequate even if the response rate is lower than expected, thus preserving the integrity of the data.\n- This deviation conforms to best practices in survey design and sampling, ensuring that the data collected is both accurate and representative.\n- The representative sampling, as required by the applied methodology, will be adhered to, ensuring that all relevant parameters are monitored effectively.\n\n### Relation to Monitoring or Measurement Criteria\n\nBoth deviations described above are strictly related to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement. They do not impact any other part of the methodology. These deviations are designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of data collection without compromising the overall methodological framework.\n\n**Confirmation:**\n- The deviations are specifically tailored to address sampling and survey procedures, ensuring that the data collected is both accurate and representative.\n- No other aspects of the methodology are affected by these deviations, ensuring that the overall integrity and conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification remain intact.\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology deviations applied are justified and supported by evidence demonstrating that they do not negatively impact the conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification. They are confined to the monitoring or measurement criteria, ensuring that the overall methodological integrity is preserved."

This factor is specified in Section 8.3 of methodology VMR0006, Version 1.1, which sets the default leakage value at 0.95.\n\n### Equations for Reductions and Removals\nThe methodology determines net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions using the following equations:\n\n#### Equation 1: Emission Reductions\n\\[ ER_y = ER_{y,i,j} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ER_y \\): Emission reductions in year \\( y \\)\n- \\( By_{savings,i,j} \\): Quantity of woody biomass saved per improved cookstove of type \\( i \\) and batch \\( j \\) during year \\( y \\)\n- \\( fNRB_y \\): Fraction of woody biomass established as non-renewable biomass\n- \\( NCV_{woodfuel} \\): Net calorific value of non-renewable woody biomass (0.0156 TJ/tonne)\n- \\( EF_{wf,CO2} \\): CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in baseline (112 tCO2/TJ)\n- \\( EF_{wf,nonCO2} \\): Non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in baseline (26.23 tCO2/TJ)\n- \\( N_{y,i,j} \\): Number of improved cookstoves of type \\( i \\) and batch \\( j \\) operating during year \\( y \\)\n- 0.95: Discount factor for leakage\n\n#### Equation 2: Biomass Savings\n\\[ By_{savings,i,j} = \\frac{By_{baseline,i,j} - By_{project,i,j}}{By_{baseline,i,j}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( By_{baseline,i,j} \\): Baseline woody biomass consumption per cookstove of type \\( i \\) and batch \\( j \\)\n- \\( By_{project,i,j} \\): Project woody biomass consumption per cookstove of type \\( i \\) and batch \\( j \\)\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\n#### Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values\nThe following emission factors and default values are used, based on the 2006 IPCC default values:\n\n- **Net Calorific Value (NCV) for wood fuel**: 0.0156 TJ/tonne\n- **CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in baseline**: 112 tCO2/TJ\n- **Non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in baseline**: 26.23 tCO2/TJ\n\nThese values are selected to ensure consistency and accuracy in the calculation of emission reductions and leakage emissions.\n\n### Example Calculation\nTo demonstrate the application of these equations, consider a project with the following parameters for year \\( y \\):\n\n- Quantity of woody biomass saved per improved cookstove (\\( By_{savings,i,j} \\)): 2 tonnes\n- Fraction of non-renewable biomass (\\( fNRB_y \\)): 0.8\n- Number of improved cookstoves operating (\\( N_{y,i,j} \\)): 100\n\nThe emission reductions (\\( ER_y \\)) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ ER_y = 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.0156 \\times (112 + 26.23) \\times 100 \\times 0.95 \\]\n\n\\[ ER_y = 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.0156 \\times 138.23 \\times 100 \\times 0.95 \\]\n\n\\[ ER_y = 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 2.156388 \\times 100 \\times 0.95 \\]\n\n\\[ ER_y = 2 \\times 1.72511 \\times 100 \\times 0.95 \\]\n\n\\[ ER_y = 327.77 \\, tCO2e \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThis section provides a comprehensive procedure for quantifying leakage emissions, including detailed equations and methodological choices. By adhering to these guidelines, users can accurately calculate emission reductions and removals, ensuring consistency with the applied methodology. All calculations should be included in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for verification and transparency."

The methodology is based on VMR0006 Version 1.1, which provides detailed equations and parameters for these calculations. Each equation is explained with the necessary data and parameters, allowing for reproducibility of the calculations.

1\\right) = 4.7034 \\text{ tonnes for year } y=2. \\]\n\n### Calculation of Emission Reductions (ER_{y,i,j}):\nGiven:\n- \\(B_{y,savings,i,j} = 4.7034\\) tonnes\n- \\(NCV_{woodfuel} = 0.0156\\) TJ/tonne\n- \\(f_{NRB,y} = 0.6882\\)\n- \\(EF_{wf,CO2} = 112\\) tCO2/TJ\n- \\(EF_{wf,non CO2} = 26.23\\) tCO2/TJ\n- \\(N_{y,i,j} = 600,000\\)\n\n\\[ ER_{y,i,j} = 4.7034 \\times 0.0156 \\times 0.6882 \\times 138.23 \\times 600,000 \\times 0.95 = 3,978,615 \\text{ tCO2e per annum.} \\]\n\n## Data and Parameters Monitored\nThe following estimated data/parameter values are used for calculations:\n\n- **Population size (N):** 600,000 households/ICS.\n- **Expected proportion (p) for \\(N_{y,i,j}\\):** 0.9.\n- **Sample size (n):** 43.\n- **Efficiency of the stove:** Varies, with a 95/10 level of confidence and precision applied for the monitoring period.\n- **Mean expected thermal efficiency of ICS in the first year:** Specific values not provided.\n\n### Sample Size Calculation:\n\\[ n = \\frac{1.962 \\times N \\times p \\times (1 -

        "generation": "## Monitoring Plan\n\n### Overview\n\nThis Monitoring Plan delineates a structured approach for systematically acquiring, recording, compiling, and analyzing the monitored data and parameters as detailed in Section 5.2 (Data and Parameters Monitored). The plan guarantees precise and dependable data collection, storage, and reporting to facilitate effective monitoring of project activities and emission reductions.\n\n### Methods for Measuring, Recording, Storing, Aggregating, Collating, and Reporting on Monitored Data and Parameters\n\n#### Measuring and Recording\n- **Techniques**: Representative sampling through physical on-site visits and surveys using hard-copy questionnaires.\n- **Parameters Monitored**: Key parameters include the number of project devices operating and the quantity of woody biomass used. These are monitored through visits, visual inspections, measurements, and interviews with end-users.\n\n#### Storing and Aggregating\n- **Data Entry**: Data collected from field surveys is entered into a standardized system to minimize errors.\n- **Data Storage**: All data is securely stored in a centralized database to ensure integrity and accessibility.\n\n#### Collating and Reporting\n- **Methodology**: The sampling methodology adheres to the 'Standard for sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities' and the 'Guidelines for sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities'.\n- **Reporting**: Data is collated and reported in compliance with these standards to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n#### Calibration of Equipment\n- **Procedures**: Although not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that all measuring equipment will be calibrated according to manufacturer specifications and industry standards to ensure accurate measurements.\n\n### Organizational Structure, Responsibilities, and Competencies\n\n#### Project Proponent\n- **Role**: Coordinates the overall monitoring and implementation of the sampling plan.\n- **Responsibility**: Guarantees successful monitoring of emission reductions and adherence to monitoring protocols.\n\n#### Management Staff\n- **Role**: Oversees the coordination of monitoring activities.\n- **Competency**: Staff are trained in the data collection process and are responsible for ensuring data quality and integrity.\n\n#### Training Programs\n- **Participants**: Project participants' representatives, nominated distributors, and third-party surveyors.\n- **Content**: Training focuses on understanding the data collection process, ensuring accurate and reliable data recording.\n\n#### Survey Execution\n- **Personnel**: Surveys are conducted by the distributor in collaboration with the project proponent.\n- **Execution**: Ensures that data collection is thorough and adheres to established protocols.\n\n### Procedures for Internal Auditing and Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)\n\n#### Coordination and Auditing\n- **Overall Coordination**: Managed by the project proponent to ensure the successful monitoring of emission reductions.\n- **Periodic Audits**: Regular audits and surveillance are conducted to verify the proper functioning of distributed stoves.\n- **Spot Audits**: Performed after installation to ensure initial compliance and functionality.\n\n#### Data Monitoring\n- **Sampling**: A representative sample is used to measure the number of operating project devices, maintaining a 95/10 confidence precision standard.\n- **Frequency**: Monitoring is conducted at least once every two years.\n\n### Procedures for Handling Non-Conformances with the Validated Monitoring Plan\n\n#### Identification and Resolution\n- **Non-Conformance**: Procedures for identifying and resolving non-conformances will be developed and implemented to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with the monitoring plan.\n- **Corrective Actions**: Specific corrective actions will be documented and tracked to prevent recurrence.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\n\n#### Techniques\n- **Stratified Random Sampling**: Utilized as per CDM guidelines to ensure representative and unbiased data collection.\n\n#### Target Precision Levels\n- **Biennial Inspections**: 95% confidence interval with a 10% margin of error.\n- **Annual Inspections**: 90% confidence interval with a 10% margin of error.\n\n#### Sample Sizes\n- **Calculation**: Determined to achieve target precision levels. If precision levels are not met, the lower bound of the confidence interval may be used.\n\n#### Sample Site Locations\n- **Determination**: Based on dissimilarity among strata such as ICS type, vintage, and project region to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n#### Frequency of Measurement\n- **Schedule**: Measurements are conducted at least once every two years to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability.\n\n#### QA/QC Procedures\n- **Validation**: Use of statistically valid samples and field surveys.\n- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurately collected and entered into the database for monitoring reports.\n\n### Line Diagrams for GHG Data Collection and Management System\n\n#### Visualization\n- **Diagram**: A line diagram will be developed to illustrate the GHG data collection and management system, providing a clear visual representation of the entire process.\n\n---\n\nThis Monitoring Plan provides a comprehensive framework for the effective and accurate monitoring of project activities, ensuring compliance with established standards and protocols. By following this plan, we can ensure the integrity and reliability of the data collected, supporting the successful monitoring of emission reductions and overall project success."
