This initiative is approved as a voluntary project and does not fall under any mandatory compliance schemes within the country.\n\n### Systematic Enforcement of Laws\n- **If the project is located in a Non-Annex 1 country and the project activities are mandated by a law, statute, or other regulatory framework, are such laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks systematically enforced?**\n  - \u2610 Yes\n  - \u2610 No\n  - \u2611 Not Applicable\n\nSince no laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks mandate the project activities in Madagascar, the question of systematic enforcement does not apply.\n\n### Evidence of Systematic Non-Enforcement\nGiven the absence of mandated laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks requiring the project activities related to the dissemination of improved cook stoves in Madagascar, there is no need to provide evidence of systematic non-enforcement. Existing policies, such as the Electricity Access and Poverty Reduction Strategy under the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), do not mandate these project activities. Additionally, the decree on the 'Compatibility of Investments and Environment' confirms that cook stove projects are not required to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment.\n\n## Additionality Methods\n\n### Application of Methodology or Tool\nThe methodology or tool applied to demonstrate additionality involves several steps that are meticulously documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results. Specific steps and outcomes are derived from the registered PoA-DD and will be detailed in subsequent sections.\n\n### Method Selected to Demonstrate Additionality\nThe method chosen to demonstrate additionality for this project is the **Barrier Analysis** method, which identifies and justifies the barriers preventing the project from being implemented without the support of the carbon finance mechanism.\n\n### Barrier Analysis\nThe barrier analysis identifies several relevant barriers justifying the additionality of the project:\n\n1. **Financial Barriers:**\n   - High upfront costs for the production and distribution of improved cook stoves.\n   - Limited access to affordable financing options for both producers and consumers.\n\n2. **Technological Barriers:**\n   - Lack of technical expertise and infrastructure to produce and maintain improved cook stoves.\n   - Limited availability of high-quality materials required for the manufacturing process.\n\n3. **Market Barriers:**\n   - Low market penetration due to lack of awareness and acceptance of improved cook stoves among the local population.\n   - Competition with traditional and cheaper cooking methods ingrained in cultural practices.\n\nEach of these barriers is substantiated with key facts and assumptions. Financial barriers are evident from the high cost of raw materials and limited access to microfinance institutions in rural areas. Technological barriers are highlighted by the absence of local manufacturers capable of producing high-quality cook stoves. Market barriers are demonstrated through surveys indicating low awareness levels and preference for traditional cooking methods.\n\n### Performance Method\nTo demonstrate that the project can achieve performance levels at least equivalent to the performance benchmark metric, the project has been designed to meet or exceed the efficiency standards set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.

The methodology adheres to specified guidelines, incorporating pertinent equations and data parameters to ensure transparency and reproducibility.\n\n## Equations for Quantification\n\nThe quantification process employs several key equations to estimate reductions and removals. Each equation is elaborated below to facilitate reproducible calculations.\n\n### 1. Baseline Emissions Calculation\n\nBaseline emissions represent the GHG emissions that would have occurred without the project. The equation for baseline emissions (BE) is:\n\n\\[ BE = \\sum (A_i \\times EF_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for source \\( i \\) (e.g., amount of fuel consumed)\n- \\( EF_i \\) = Emission factor for source \\( i \\) (e.g., CO2 emitted per unit of fuel)\n\n### 2. Project Emissions Calculation\n\nProject emissions (PE) are the GHG emissions resulting from the project activities. The equation is:\n\n\\[ PE = \\sum (A_i \\times EF_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for project source \\( i \\)\n- \\( EF_i \\) = Emission factor for project source \\( i \\)\n\n### 3. Leakage Emissions Calculation\n\nLeakage emissions (LE) are the GHG emissions occurring outside the project boundary due to project activities. The equation is:\n\n\\[ LE = \\sum (A_i \\times EF_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for leakage source \\( i \\)\n- \\( EF_i \\) = Emission factor for leakage source \\( i \\)\n\n### 4. GHG Emission Reductions Calculation\n\nGHG emission reductions (ER) are calculated by subtracting project and leakage emissions from baseline emissions:\n\n\\[ ER = BE - (PE + LE) \\]\n\n### 5. Carbon Dioxide Removals Calculation\n\nCarbon dioxide removals (CR) are calculated based on the amount of CO2 sequestered by the project activities. The equation is:\n\n\\[ CR = \\sum (A_i \\times SR_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for removal activity \\( i \\)\n- \\( SR_i \\) = Sequestration rate for removal activity \\( i \\)\n\n## Data and Parameters Monitored\n\nData and parameter values used in the calculations are derived from Section 5.2. These values are crucial for accurate quantification and include:\n\n- Activity data (e.g., fuel consumption, biomass growth)\n- Emission factors (e.g., CO2 per unit of fuel)\n- Sequestration rates (e.g., CO2 sequestered per unit of biomass)\n\n## Example Calculations\n\nTo illustrate the application of the equations, example calculations for a given vintage period are provided.\n\n### Example Vintage Period: DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY\n\n#### Baseline Emissions\n\\[ BE = 50,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### Project Emissions\n\\[ PE = 20,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### Leakage Emissions\n\\[ LE = 10,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### GHG Emission Reductions\n\\[ ER = 50,000 - (20,000 + 10,000) = 20,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### Carbon Dioxide Removals\n\\[ CR = 10,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n### Summary Table for Non-Permanence Risk Assessment\n\nFor projects required to assess permanence risk, the following table summarizes the estimated values:\n\n| Vintage Period         | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | 50,000                               | 20,000                               | 10,000                              | 4,000                                     | 8,000                            | 8,000                           | 16,000                                 |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                           |                                  |                                 |                                        |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                           |                                  |                                 |                                        |\n| Total                  |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                           |                                  |                                 |                                        |\n\n### Summary Table for Non-Permanence Risk Rating\n\n| Non-Permanence Risk Rating (%) | Example: 20% |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| Has the non-permanence risk report been attached as either an appendix or a separate document? | \u2611 Yes \u2610 No |\n| For ARR and IFM projects with harvesting, state, in tCO2e, the Long-term Average (LTA). | Example: 300,000 tCO2e |\n| Has the LTA been updated based on monitored data, if applicable? | \u2611 Yes \u2610 No |\n| State, in tCO2e, the expected total GHG benefit to date. | 377,220 tCO2e |\n| Is the number of GHG credits issued below the LTA? | \u2611 Yes \u2610 No |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe detailed procedure and equations provided in this document enable the accurate quantification of GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals.
