        "generation": "### 1.13 Conditions Existing Prior to Project Initiation\n\nIn accordance with the Paragraph 4 of the chosen methodology, AMS - II.G; 'Energy Efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass,' EB 68, Version 04, the baseline for the project activity is defined as 'the use of fossil fuels for meeting similar thermal energy needs.' In the absence of the project activity, the beneficiaries could have opted for the following options for cooking:\n\n1. Continuation of using traditional stoves for cooking\n2. Use of kerosene for cooking\n3. Use of LPG for cooking\n4. Use of biomass-based improved cook stoves\n\nAll the above options for cooking are permitted according to the regulations of the host country. However, some of these fuel options face barriers in rural areas, as depicted below.\n\n### Imbalance Between Demand and Supply of Fuel Wood\n\nA significant issue before the project was the imbalance between the demand and supply of fuel wood. This imbalance had led to unsustainable extraction of firewood from local forests. Due to increasing population pressure, the demand for firewood had outstripped natural regeneration and planting efforts, causing severe shortages in some areas. This unsustainable practice not only threatened local ecosystems but also increased the workload on households, particularly women and children, who were primarily responsible for collecting firewood.\n\nAs per the study by 'National Institute of Science, Technology & Development Studies (NISTADS), CSIR, New Delhi,' it is highlighted that poor rural households could not afford and were also not willing to opt for improved cook stoves since wood was available for free. Households that opted for improved stoves did so only for subsidy, hence the use of biomass-based cook stoves was not a pertinent or plausible scenario. The percentages of the population relying on different fuel types in rural areas of Maharashtra for cooking are as follows:\n\n| Fuel Type                   | Firewood | LPG | Kerosene | No cooking arrangement | Others |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-----|----------|------------------------|--------|\n| Percentage of population    | 78%      | 15% | 1%       | 3%                     | 2%     |\n\nFrom the above figures, it is evident that the percentage of the population depending on firewood in rural areas is quite high in the state. The publication titled 'Household Energy and the Environment' depicts that, although nationally there has been a decrease in the share of traditional fuels, as biomass is being increasingly substituted by commercial fuels, the shift to commercial fuels has been negligible in rural areas. The energy consumption in rural areas is guided by the availability and accessibility of local biomass resources, the competing uses for biomass, availability of commercial energy sources, the cost of commercial fuels such as LPG and kerosene (NCAER 1985), absence of an effective supply especially in rural areas (TERI 1998), and inadequate production and refining capacity of LPG (Ravindranath and Ramakrishna 1997). Over and above these barriers, the issue of affordability of commercial fuel is a significant issue among the populations conceived under the project activity, hence the use of commercial fuel is not a usual scenario among the BPL and ST population. Therefore, the use of LPG or Kerosene is not the plausible baseline option.\n\n### Project Implementation and GHG Emissions\n\nThe project was not implemented with the intention of generating GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction. Instead, it aims to address the environmental and social issues arising from the pre-existing conditions. By promoting the use of improved cook stoves and reducing reliance on non-renewable biomass, the project seeks to achieve a significant reduction in GHG emissions. Specifically, the project is expected to result in an annual reduction of 12,945 tCO2e.\n\n### Baseline Scenario\n\nThe baseline scenario differs from the conditions existing prior to the project initiation. While the pre-project conditions included the use of traditional stoves, kerosene, LPG, and biomass-based improved cook stoves, the baseline scenario is specifically defined as the continued use of traditional cook stoves using biomass. Therefore, the baseline scenario is not a repetition of the pre-project conditions but rather a focused representation of what would have continued in the absence of the project.\n\nFor a detailed description of the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) of this document. Additionally, comprehensive details can be found in sections B 6.1 and B 4 of the Project Design Document (PDD) of the UNFCCC registered CDM project reference no. 9501. The document is available at the following link: [UNFCCC PDD Document](https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1356978179.26/view).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the conditions prior to the project initiation were characterized by an over-reliance on traditional cooking methods, leading to unsustainable firewood extraction and significant GHG emissions. The project was implemented to mitigate these issues and not for the purpose of generating emissions for subsequent reduction. The baseline scenario, which reflects the continued use of traditional stoves, differs from the pre-project conditions and has been described in detail in the relevant sections of the Project Design Document."

This document elucidates the methodology and procedures employed to identify and justify the baseline scenario, encompassing the assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices made.\n\n#### Identification of the Baseline Scenario\nThe baseline scenario for this project entails the continued utilization of traditional stoves for cooking, along with kerosene, LPG, or biomass-based improved cook stoves. Among these, the most plausible baseline option for the target demographic is the use of traditional cook stoves.\n\n#### Procedure to Identify the Baseline Scenario\nThe methodology employed to ascertain the baseline scenario adheres to a structured approach. This involves referencing specific sections of the Project Design Document (PDD), considering default emission factors, and utilizing supporting indicators such as survey results, national or local statistics, studies, maps, or remote-sensing data.\n\n#### Steps Involved in the Procedure\n1. **Determination of Baseline Fuel Wood Consumption**: The baseline fuel wood consumption is adjusted by a net-to-gross factor of 0.95 to account for leakages.\n2. **Calculation of Baseline Emission Factor**: A default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ is used without assessing alternatives.\n3. **Estimation of Emission Reductions**: The emission reductions are calculated using the formula:\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   ER_y = B_{y,savings} \\times fNRB_y \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projected fossil fuel}\n   \n   where:\n   - ER_y = Emission reductions in year y\n   - B_{y,savings} = Quantity of woody biomass saved\n   - fNRB_y = Fraction of non-renewable biomass\n   - NCV_{biomass} = Net calorific value of biomass\n   - EF_{projected fossil fuel} = Emission factor of projected fossil fuel\n\n4. **Support for Non-renewable Biomass Usage**: This is demonstrated through the gap between firewood demand and permissible production, supported by published literature and studies.\n\n#### Key Assumptions and Rationale\n1. **Baseline Emission Factor**: The default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ is used to simplify the calculation process, as it is a recognized standard.\n2. **Emission Reductions Calculation**: The chosen formula is comprehensive and considers all relevant variables, ensuring accurate estimation of emission reductions.\n3. **fNRB Estimation**: The fraction of non-renewable biomass is supported by indicators like survey results, national or local statistics, studies, maps, remote-sensing data, and trends in fuel wood prices.\n4. **Project Activity**: The project focuses on efficiency improvements in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass, particularly through the dissemination of higher efficiency biomass-fired cook stoves.\n5. **Non-renewable Biomass Usage**: The rationale behind this assumption is supported by evidence of a gap between firewood demand and permissible production, indicating reliance on non-renewable sources.\n\n#### Methodological Choices\nThe selection of small-scale methodologies under Type II is justified, as the cumulative energy savings are less than 20 GWh/annum or 60 GWhth/annum. Specifically, the project employs AMS-II.G. (Version 04) for efficiency improvements in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass.\n\n#### Relevant References\n- **Project Design Document (PDD)**: UNFCCC registered CDM project with reference no. 9501.\n- **Sections Referenced**: B 4, B 5, B 6.1, B 7.3, E 1, and E 2.\n- **Methodology**: 'Energy Efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass', AMS - II.G, EB 68, Version 04.0.0.\n- **Web Link**: [UNFCCC Project Details](https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1356978179.26/view)\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe identification and justification of the baseline scenario follow a systematic and methodologically sound approach, ensuring that the most plausible baseline option is accurately determined.
