This section delineates the procedures and methodologies employed to calculate baseline emissions and changes in carbon stocks, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### Quantification of Baseline Emissions\n\nBaseline emissions represent the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have occurred in the absence of the project. To quantify these emissions, specific equations are applied, considering factors such as the efficiency of traditional cookstoves, the amount of woody biomass used, and the emission factors for CO2 and non-CO2 gases.\n\n#### Relevant Equations\n\n1. **Net GHG Emission Reductions**:\n   \n   \n   ER_{y,i,j} = B_{y,savings,i,j} \\times NCV_{wood \\, fuel} \\times fNRB_{y} \\times (EF_{wf,CO2} + EF_{wf,non \\, CO2}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95\n\n   - ER_{y,i,j}: Emission reductions for year y, cookstove type i, and batch j.\n   - B_{y,savings,i,j}: Quantity of woody biomass saved.\n   - NCV_{wood \\, fuel}: Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass.\n   - fNRB_{y}: Fraction of woody biomass that is non-renewable.\n   - EF_{wf,CO2}: CO2 emission factor for wood fuel.\n   - EF_{wf,non \\, CO2}: Non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel.\n   - N_{y,i,j}: Number of improved cookstoves in use.\n   - The factor 0.95 accounts for leakage.\n\n2. **Quantity of Woody Biomass Saved**:\n   \n   \n   B_{y,savings,i,j} = B_{y=1,new,i,survey} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\eta_{new,y,i,j}}{\\eta_{old}} - 1 \\right)\n\n   - B_{y=1,new,i,survey}: Quantity of woody biomass saved in the first year.\n   - \\eta_{new,y,i,j}: Efficiency of the improved cookstove.\n   - \\eta_{old}: Efficiency of the traditional cookstove.\n\n3. **Efficiency of Improved Cookstove**:\n   \n   \n   \\eta_{new,y,i,j} = \\eta_{p} \\times (DF_{n})^{y-1} \\times 0.94\n\n   - \\eta_{p}: Initial efficiency of the improved cookstove.\n   - DF_{n}: Degradation factor for the cookstove efficiency over time.\n\n### Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\n\nCarbon stock changes refer to the variations in the amount of carbon stored in biomass due to project activities. These changes can result in either carbon sequestration (sinks) or emissions. The procedure includes monitoring biomass usage and applying specific equations to estimate net changes.\n\n### Handling of Baseline Emissions and Carbon Stock Increases\n\nIn scenarios where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions, the baseline emissions may be considered negative, indicating a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The methodology requires separate quantification of reductions and removals to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nThe methodological choices made in this process include:\n\n- **Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values**:\n  - IPCC default values are utilized for various parameters.\n  - A default efficiency value of 0.1 is applied for traditional three-stone fires or conventional devices without improved combustion air supply or flue gas ventilation.\n  - Leakage is accounted for with a default value of 0.95.\n  - The net calorific value of non-renewable woody biomass is set at 0.0156 TJ/tonne.\n  - The CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in the baseline scenario is 112 tCO2/TJ.\n  - The non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in the baseline scenario is 26.23 tCO2/TJ.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nAll calculations for emission reductions and removals are documented in an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This spreadsheet includes detailed data inputs, intermediate calculations, and final results, allowing for full transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy adhering to the outlined procedures and utilizing the specified equations, we ensure accurate and transparent quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes. This methodology provides a robust framework for assessing the environmental benefits of improved cookstove projects, contributing to the overarching goal of reducing GHG emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration."

they collect and prepare fuel can be challenging. Targeting populations that already spend time or energy on fuel preparation or those experiencing a lack of access to cheap firewood is suggested. The organization is conducting a pilot distribution to understand the acceptability of the ICS model and is open to other models based on user feedback.\n2. **Keeping a relationship with target communities**: User satisfaction is higher where there is an ongoing relationship with target communities. This is achieved by partnering with projects like World Vision's nutrition project and appointing Village Stove Pioneers to provide guidance and support. For parameters requiring precision, if reliability checks do not achieve the required precision, the lower or upper bound of estimates can be used. Outliers, defined as data points greater than three standard deviations from the mean, will be examined for errors and omitted from analysis if no errors are found.\n\nThis summary captures the essential details of the data and parameters monitored during the project crediting period."
