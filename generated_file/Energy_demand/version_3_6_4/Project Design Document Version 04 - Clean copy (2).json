In the absence of the project activity, beneficiaries might have opted for the following cooking options:\n\n1. Continuation of traditional stoves\n2. Use of kerosene\n3. Use of LPG\n4. Use of biomass-based improved cook stoves\n\nAll these options are permitted by the host country's regulations. However, several barriers exist, particularly in rural areas, which are elaborated below.\n\nA study by the 'National Institute of Science, Technology & Development Studies (NISTADS), CSIR, New Delhi' highlights that poor rural households often cannot afford and are not willing to opt for improved cook stoves since wood is available for free. Households that do opt for improved stoves usually do so only with subsidies, making the widespread use of biomass-based cook stoves an implausible scenario. The percentages of the population relying on different fuel types in rural Maharashtra for cooking are as follows:\n\n|                      | Firewood | LPG | Kerosene | No cooking arrangement | Others |\n|----------------------|----------|-----|----------|------------------------|--------|\n| Percentage of population | 78%      | 15% | 1%       | 3%                     | 2%     |\n\nFrom these figures, it is evident that a significant portion of the rural population depends on firewood. The publication 'Household Energy and the Environment' indicates that although there has been a national shift from traditional fuels to commercial fuels, this shift is negligible in rural areas. Factors such as the availability and accessibility of local biomass resources, the cost of commercial fuels like LPG and kerosene, and the absence of an effective supply chain in rural areas contribute to this scenario. Affordability is a significant issue, particularly among the BPL and ST populations, making the use of LPG or Kerosene an implausible option.\n\nThus, it can be concluded that the use of biomass in traditional cook stoves is the most plausible baseline option for the target population.\n\nThe methodology identifies the baseline and suggests a baseline emission factor, which is considered as precedence. Therefore, an assessment of alternatives is not carried out for determining the baseline and emission factor. According to Paragraph 5 of the applicable methodology, a default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ is considered for estimating emission reductions. Emission reductions are calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ ER_y = B_y, savings \\times f_{NRB, y} \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ER_y \\) = Emission reductions during the year y in tCO2e\n- \\( B_y, savings \\) = Quantity of woody biomass saved in tonnes\n- \\( f_{NRB, y} \\) = Fraction of woody biomass saved by the project activity in year y that is non-renewable\n- \\( NCV_{biomass} \\) = Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass substituted (IPCC default for wood fuel, 0.015 TJ/tonne)\n- \\( EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\) = Emission factor for the substitution of non-renewable woody biomass by similar consumers, valued at 81.6 tCO2/TJ\n\n\\[ B_y, savings = B_{old} \\times (1 - \\frac{\\eta_{old}}{\\eta_{new}}) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( B_y, savings \\) = Quantity of woody biomass saved in tonnes\n- \\( B_{old} \\) = Quantity of woody biomass used in the absence of the project activity in tonnes\n- \\( \\eta_{old} \\) = Default value of 0.10 for traditional systems with no improved combustion air supply or flue gas ventilation system\n- \\( \\eta_{new} \\) = Efficiency of the system deployed as part of the project activity, determined using the Water Boiling Test (WBT) protocol\n\n**Determination of Bold:**\nAccording to Paragraph 7 of the chosen methodology, Bold is determined using Option (a): 'Calculated as the product of the number of systems multiplied by the estimated average annual consumption of woody biomass per appliance (tonnes/year).' This can be derived from historical data or a survey of local usage. According to the 'Wood Fuel Trade in India \u2013 Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, July 2001', per capita per day biomass consumption is 1.52 kg, and per household per day fuel wood consumption is 5.60 kg, leading to an annual household consumption estimate of 2.044 tonnes.\n\nFollowing the TERI Energy Data Directory and Yearbook 2010, per capita per month consumption of firewood in Maharashtra is 25.51 kg. With an average household size of 4.8 persons, the annual consumption of firewood is estimated at 1.469 tonnes. The value of 1.469 tonnes/household/year is considered most conservative. Therefore,\n\n\\[ B_{old} = 1.469 \\text{ tonnes/household/year} \\]\n\n**Determination of \\( \\eta_{old} \\)**\nSince the project replaces traditional cooking systems with no improved combustion air supply or flue gas ventilation system, the efficiency of the replaced system is chosen as 0.10, as per Alternative 2 of Option 2 of Paragraph 6.\n\n**Determination of \\( \\eta_{new} \\)**\nEfficiency of the system deployed in the project activity is chosen as 29.88%, based on the Performance Test of Improved Cook stoves by the Department of Renewable Energy Sources, Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture & Technology.\n\n\\[ \\eta_{new} = 29.88% \\]\n\n**Determination of \\( f_{NRB,y} \\)**\nAccording to Paragraph 8 of the chosen methodology, 'Project participants shall determine the shares of renewable and non-renewable woody biomass in Bold using nationally approved methods (e.g., surveys or government data) and then determine \\( f_{NRB,y} \\).' The fraction of woody biomass saved due to the project activity that is non-renewable is estimated as:\n\n\\[ f_{NRB,y} = \\frac{NRB}{NRB + DRB} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- NRB: Non-Renewable Biomass\n\nAccording to Paragraph 9 of the applicable methodology, Demonstrably Renewable woody Biomass (DRB) is justified by satisfying the following conditions:\n1. Land Area Remains a Forest: The forest area in Maharashtra over the last five years is as follows:\n\n| Study Period | Total area under forest (sq.km) | Reporting Year |\n|--------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| 2010-11      | 61,939                          | 2011-12        |\n| 2009-10      | 61,939                          | 2010-11        |\n| 2008-09      | 61,939                          | 2009-10        |\n| 2007-08      | 61,939                          | 2008-09        |\n| 2006-07      | 61,939                          | 2007-08        |\n\nThe table confirms that the land under forest has remained consistent. Therefore, it is evident that the land area under forest remains unchanged.\n2. Sustainable management practices ensure that carbon stocks on these land areas do not systematically decrease over time. Practices like afforestation, reforestation, and forest conservation are part of the National Forest Policy, 1988 by the Ministry of Environment & Forests, Govt. of India. The National Mission for Green India, part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, calls for forest conservation policies.\nTo prevent illicit tree cutting, the Maharashtra State has implemented Joint Forest Management/Forest Protection Committees with active rural participation. These committees manage forest land sustainably.\n3. Compliance with national or regional forestry and nature conservation regulations is ensured. According to Circular No. FLD/1000/CR 243/F-3 of the Government of Maharashtra, the forest land is governed by the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, amended in 1988, which aims to check deforestation and conserve forests.\n\n**Fuel Wood Demand**\nThe demand for fuel wood in Maharashtra is estimated based on the percentage of the rural population relying on firewood and average per-capita consumption. The demand is as follows:\n\n| Particulars                                   | Data            | Unit                  | Reference                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rural Population                              | 55,778,000.00   | Nos.                  | Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2010-11                                  |\n| Percentage of households reliant on biomass for cooking | 78.00          | %                     | TERI Energy Data Directory & Yearbook 2010                             |\n| Population Dependent on the Fuel Wood         | 43,506,840.00   | Nos.                  | Calculated                                                             |\n| Per capita fuel wood consumption for cooking  | 25.51           | kg/month              | TERI Energy Data Directory & Yearbook 2010                             |\n| Fuel Wood requirement                         | 13,318,313.86   | tonne/year            | Calculated                                                             |\n\n**Supply of Fire Wood**\nForest is the major source of firewood supply, followed by Trees outside the Forest. The sustainable extraction from forest and plantation areas is estimated based on the area under different forest types and extraction rates. A conservative approach includes open forest and scrub areas.\n\n**Sustainable Fuel wood Extraction From Forest Area**\n\n| Particulars               | Data     | Unit   | Reference

applicable methodology, the fNRB estimation is as above, supported by:\n\n- Survey results, national or local statistics, studies, maps, or other sources showing carbon stock depletion in the project area.\n- Increasing trends in fuel wood prices indicating scarcity.\n\n**1. Depletion of Carbon Stock**\n\nAccording to the India State of Forest Report by the Forest Survey of India, there has been a conversion of dense and moderately dense forest to open forest due to tree felling, pruning, or thinning. An increase in open forest area is related to the diversion of dense forests. The table below represents the area under different forest covers:\n\n| Year | Very Dense | Moderately Dense | Open Forest | Total |\n|------|------------|------------------|-------------|-------|\n| 2011 | 8,736      | 20,815           | 21,095      | 50,646|\n| 2009 | 8,739      | 20,834           | 21,077      | 50,650|\n| 2005 | 8,747      | 20,847           | 21,067      | 50,661|\n\nThe 'Population Pressure and Deforestation in India' study by the Population Research Centre, Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi, shows a depletion of forest stock from 1989 to 1997. The volume of growing stock reduced by 2% over this period.\n\n**2. Increase in Fuel Wood Price Trend**\n\nThe National Sample Survey Organisation's 2004 consumer expenditure survey shows that 54% of rural cooking and lighting expenditure pertains to fuel wood. The average monthly per capita expenditure on fuel wood has increased over the years:\n\n| Year      | 1997  | 1998  | 1999-2000 | 2000-2001 | 2002  | 2003  | 2005-2006 | 2006-2007 |\n|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Average Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (Rs.) | 27.97  | 31.79 | 36.45     | 44.14     | 51.70 | 56.20 | 68.77     | 76.20     |\n\nThe increasing price trend is due to the demand-supply gap and unsustainable extraction. The depletion of carbon stocks is due to unsustainable biomass extraction from forests, not national policies. The national policy aims to increase forest area, which is currently lower than the projected requirement.\n\nFor more details, refer to section B 4 of the PDD of the UNFCCC registered CDM project with Ref No. 9436: [https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1356871614.6/view](https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1356871614.6/view)"

The use of traditional cook stoves, characterized by low thermal efficiency (approximately 10%), is considered the most plausible baseline option for the target population. This scenario is reflective of the current practices and energy consumption patterns in the region.\n\n### Procedure Set Out in the Applied Methodology\n\n#### Methodology Overview\nThe identification of the baseline scenario follows the procedure outlined in Paragraph 4 of the AMS-II.G methodology. According to this methodology, the baseline scenario is defined as the use of fossil fuels to meet similar thermal energy needs. This approach simplifies the baseline identification process by focusing on the prevalent use of traditional cook stoves and their associated emission factors.\n\n### Steps Involved in the Procedure\n\n#### Step 1: Identifying the Baseline\nThe first step involves recognizing the baseline scenario as the use of fossil fuels for meeting thermal energy needs. This is based on the assumption that traditional cook stoves, which have a thermal efficiency of 10%, represent the current standard practice in the target area.\n\n#### Step 2: Considering Default Emission Factors\nThe second step involves utilizing default emission factors for estimating emissions reductions. This approach ensures consistency and simplifies the calculation process by avoiding the need for extensive data collection on alternative scenarios.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculating Emission Reductions\nThe final step involves calculating the emission reductions using the following formula:\n\\[ ER_y = B_{y,savings} \\times f_{NRB,y} \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( B_{y,savings} \\) is the baseline savings,\n- \\( f_{NRB,y} \\) is the fraction of non-renewable biomass,\n- \\( NCV_{biomass} \\) is the net calorific value of the biomass,\n- \\( EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\) is the emission factor of the projected fossil fuel.\n\nThe specific calculation for baseline savings is:\n\\[ B_{y,savings} = B_{old} \\times (1 - \\frac{\\eta_{old}}{\\eta_{new}}) \\]\n\n### Application of Each Step\n\n#### Outcome of Each Step\n- **Estimated Baseline Emissions or Removals:** 13,589 tCO2e\n- **Estimated Project Emissions or Removals:** 0 tCO2e\n- **Estimated Leakage Emissions:** 680 tCO2e\n- **Estimated Net GHG Emission Reductions or Removals:** 12,909 tCO2e\n\n### Key Assumptions\n\n#### Assumptions\n1.

Emission reduction calculation formula.\n5. Baseline identified as the use of fossil fuels.\n6. Compliance with AMS-II.G (Version 03) applicability criteria.\n\n### Justification for Methodological Choices\n\n#### Justification\n- **Efficiency and Biomass Reduction:** Improved cook stoves enhance thermal efficiency and reduce biomass consumption, aligning with the goals of AMS-II.G methodology.\n- **Consistency with Methodology:** The chosen approach is consistent with the AMS-II.G methodology's focus on efficiency improvements.\n- **Historical Use of Biomass:** The historical use of non-renewable biomass since 1989 is well-documented, supporting the baseline scenario.\n- **Clear Calculation Framework:** The methodology provides a clear framework for baseline and emission reduction calculations.\n- **Small-Scale Methodology Compliance:** The project meets the criteria for small-scale methodologies, ensuring its applicability.\n\n### Relevant References\n1.

The relevant regulations include:\n\n- Environment Impact Assessment Notification by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India.\n- Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (amended in 1988).\n- National Forest Policy 1988 by the Government of India.\n- National Mission for Green India under the National Action Plan on Climate Change.\n\n**Evidence of Non-enforcement**:\nTo demonstrate regulatory surplus, it is critical to provide evidence of systematic non-enforcement of the mandated laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks. However, the required evidence is not provided within the extracted parts. Therefore, further investigation and documentation are necessary to establish the regulatory surplus definitively.\n\n#### 2. Additionality Methods\n\n**Steps and Outcomes of Applied Methodology**:\nThe applied methodology involves a series of steps to demonstrate additionality. Each step is documented below to ensure transparency and reproducibility.\n\n**Baseline Scenario**:\nThe baseline scenario involves the use of fossil fuels for thermal energy needs and traditional stoves, kerosene, or LPG for cooking.\n\n**Applicability Criteria of Methodology AMS-II.G (Version 03)**:\n- **Criteria 1**: Appliances must improve the efficiency of thermal applications of non-renewable biomass, such as high-efficiency biomass-fired cook stoves.\n- **Criteria 2**: Demonstration that non-renewable biomass has been used since 31 December 1989.\n\n**Selected Method for Demonstrating Additionality**:\nThe selected method is not explicitly indicated in the provided information. However, the barrier analysis method appears to be a significant component.\n\n**Barrier Analysis**:\nThe barrier analysis method identifies and justifies the barriers that prevent the project from being implemented without the support of the CDM. The key barriers include:\n\n- **Economic Barriers**: Poor rural households' inability to afford improved cook stoves.\n- **Market Barriers**: High dependency on firewood (78%) in rural areas of Maharashtra, with negligible shift to commercial fuels due to cost, supply issues, and inadequate production and refining capacity of LPG.\n\nThese barriers are credible and supported by key facts and assumptions, such as the high percentage of households reliant on biomass for cooking and the economic constraints of rural communities.\n\n**Performance Method**:\nInformation on demonstrating that performance can be achieved to a level at least equivalent to the performance benchmark metric is not provided. Additional data and analysis are required to substantiate this method.\n\n**Activity Method**:\nConformance with the positive list in the Applicability of Methodology section is not explicitly stated. A statement confirming this conformance should be included in the final documentation.\n\n**Relevant Data and Parameters**:\nTo ensure that the additionality analysis can be reproduced and the same results obtained, refer to the following sections of the Project Design Document (PDD) of the UNFCCC registered CDM project with reference no. 8687:\n\n- Sections: E 1, E 2, D 1, B 6.2, B.7.1, and B.7.3.\n- PDD Link: [UNFCCC Project 8687](https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1355235566.14/view).\n\nSpecific data and parameters, such as the rural population, percentage of households reliant on biomass for cooking, and the default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ, are detailed in the PDD.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis section has provided a detailed demonstration and assessment of the additionality of the project. By addressing regulatory surplus and various additionality methods, we have laid the groundwork for confirming the project's additionality. However, further evidence and detailed analysis are required to fully substantiate the claims, particularly regarding regulatory surplus and performance method."

Overview\nThe quantification of estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals involves a systematic approach using specific equations. These calculations consider the quantity of woody biomass saved, the fraction of non-renewable biomass, the net calorific value of the biomass, and the emission factor for the substitution of non-renewable woody biomass.\n\n## 2. Relevant Equations\n\n### Emission Reductions (ERy)\nThe emission reductions during the year (ERy) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[\nERy = By,savings \\times fNRB,y \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projectedfossilfuel}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- **ERy**: Emission reductions during the year y in tCO2e.\n- **By,savings**: Quantity of woody biomass saved in tonnes.\n- **fNRB,y**: Fraction of woody biomass saved by the project activity in year y that can be established as non-renewable biomass.\n- **NCV_{biomass}**: Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass that is substituted (IPCC default for wood fuel, 0.015 TJ/tonne).\n- **EF_{projectedfossilfuel}**: Emission factor for the substitution of non-renewable woody biomass by similar consumers (81.6 tCO2/TJ).\n\n### Quantity of Woody Biomass Saved (By,savings)\nThe quantity of woody biomass saved (By,savings) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nBy,savings = Bold \\times (1 - \\frac{\\eta_{old}}{\\eta_{new}})\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Bold**: Quantity of woody biomass used in the absence of the project activity in tonnes.\n- **\\eta_{old}**: Efficiency of the old system, with a default value of 0.10 if the replaced system is a three-stone fire or a conventional system with no improvements.\n- **\\eta_{new}**: Efficiency of the new system implemented by the project.\n\n## 3. Application of Equations\n\n### Step 1: Calculate By,savings\nFirst, determine the quantity of woody biomass saved using the equation:\n\n\\[\nBy,savings = Bold \\times (1 - \\frac{\\eta_{old}}{\\eta_{new}})\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate ERy\nNext, calculate the emission reductions using the equation:\n\n\\[\nERy = By,savings \\times fNRB,y \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projectedfossilfuel}\n\\]\n\n## 4. Data and Parameters Monitored\nThe following data/parameter values are monitored and used in calculations:\n\n- For the years 04-October-2012 to 03-October-2013, 04-October-2013 to 03-October-2014, and 04-October-2014 to 03-October-2015:\n  - Estimated baseline emissions or removals: 13,589 tCO2e.\n  - Estimated project emissions or removals: 0 tCO2e.\n  - Estimated leakage emissions: 680 tCO2e.\n  - Estimated net GHG emission reductions or removals: 12,909 tCO2e.\n\n## 5.
