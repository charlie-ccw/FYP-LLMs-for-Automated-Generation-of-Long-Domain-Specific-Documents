        "generation": "### Summary Description of the Timor-Leste ICS Project\n\n#### 1. Technologies/Measures to be Implemented\nThe Timor-Leste Improved Cookstove (ICS) Project aims to enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by distributing and implementing energy-efficient cookstoves across all districts of Timor-Leste. The project will replace traditional three-stone stoves with jumbo stove-type ICS, which boast a thermal efficiency of 38%. These improved cookstoves significantly reduce firewood consumption and harmful emissions. The initiative also includes community training on stove maintenance and proper usage, continuous monitoring through surveys, and the potential future introduction of advanced technologies.\n\n#### 2. Location of the Project\nThis project spans the entire nation of Timor-Leste, encompassing all its districts. Key municipalities involved in the project include Dili, Manatuto, Aileu, Ermera, Likisa, Ainaro, Laut\u00e9m, Viqueque, Baucau, Ambeno, Atauro, Manufahi, Bobonaro, and Covalima.\n\n#### 3. Generation of GHG Emission Reductions or Carbon Dioxide Removals\nThe project aims to generate significant GHG emission reductions by replacing 200,000 traditional three-stone cookstoves with improved cookstoves (ICS). These ICS units require less firewood, thereby decreasing the consumption of non-renewable woody biomass and reducing CO2 emissions. Additionally, the project will help curb deforestation and enhance local ecosystems. Emission reductions will be calculated using the VMR0006 methodology, focusing on the mass of non-renewable woody biomass saved. The project is projected to reduce approximately 507,463 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) annually, totaling about 5,074,630 tCO2e over a ten-year crediting period.\n\n#### 4. Scenario Existing Prior to the Implementation of the Project\nPrior to the implementation of this project, the majority of households in Timor-Leste, particularly in rural areas, relied on traditional three-stone stoves for cooking. These stoves were highly inefficient, consuming large amounts of firewood (approximately 3.45 tonnes per stove per year) and causing chronic health issues due to smoke inhalation. Previous pilot programs aimed at introducing improved cookstoves were unsuccessful in scaling up due to high upfront costs, lack of resources, poor technology selection, and insufficient community involvement.\n\n#### 5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals\nThe project is estimated to achieve an annual average reduction and removal of 507,463 tCO2e. Over a ten-year period, the total reduction and removal is projected to be 5,074,630 tCO2e.\n\nThis comprehensive approach to implementing energy-efficient cookstoves in Timor-Leste not only addresses environmental concerns but also promotes health benefits and sustainable development within the community."

        "generation": "### Description of the Project Activity\n\n#### Project Activities and Technologies Employed\n\nThe project is set to distribute and implement improved cooking stoves (ICS) across all districts of Timor-Leste. The primary technology employed is the Jumbo stove-type ICS, which boasts a thermal efficiency of 38%. This efficiency marks a significant improvement over the traditional three-stone stoves commonly used in the region. By enhancing heat transfer efficiency, the project aims to significantly reduce unsustainable fuelwood consumption, thereby achieving substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.\n\nBeyond reducing CO2 emissions, the project offers several ancillary benefits. These include preventing deforestation, enhancing local ecosystems, improving indoor air quality, and increasing family welfare by reducing the time and effort required for fuelwood collection.\n\n#### Implementation Schedule\n\nThe project is planned to span over ten years, with a detailed distribution schedule as follows:\n\n- **Year 1**: 30,000 ICS\n- **Year 2**: 50,000 ICS\n- **Year 3**: 60,000 ICS\n- **Year 4**: 60,000 ICS\n- **Year 5**: 200,000 ICS\n- **Year 6**: 200,000 ICS\n- **Year 7**: 200,000 ICS\n- **Year 8**: 170,000 ICS\n- **Year 9**: 120,000 ICS\n- **Year 10**: 60,000 ICS\n\n#### Main Manufacturing/Production Technologies, Systems, and Equipment\n\nThe primary technology utilized in this project is the Improved Cookstove (ICS), specifically the Jumbo Stove. Constructed from durable materials such as steel and aluminium, the ICS ensures longevity and robustness. Key specifications include:\n\n- **Thermal Efficiency**: 38% (as per ISO 19867 standard water boiling test)\n- **Lifespan**: Expected to last between six to seven years\n- **Loading Capacity**: 40 kg, suitable for various solid fuels including wood, cow-dung, and agro-waste\n- **Selection Criteria for New ICS**: Minimum thermal efficiency of 35% and an expected lifetime of five years\n\nThese stoves are designed to replace the traditional three-stone stoves, which are inefficient and contribute significantly to deforestation and indoor air pollution.\n\n#### Types and Levels of Services Provided\n\nThe ICS units are designed to meet the same thermal energy needs as the traditional three-stone stoves, primarily used for cooking and boiling water. The improved efficiency of the ICS means that less fuel is required to achieve the same levels of thermal energy, thus reducing overall fuelwood consumption and associated emissions.\n\nThe improved cookstoves are directly related to other manufacturing/production equipment and systems outside the project boundary by reducing the demand for non-renewable biomass fuels, thereby decreasing the pressure on local forests and ecosystems.\n\n#### Baseline Scenario\n\nIn the baseline scenario, the same thermal energy needs are met using non-renewable wood fuel and traditional three-stone stoves. These stoves are highly inefficient, leading to excessive fuel consumption and higher GHG emissions. The traditional method of cooking also contributes to deforestation and poor indoor air quality, adversely affecting the health and welfare of families.\n\n#### Existing Scenario Prior to Project Implementation\n\nBefore the implementation of the project, the prevalent cooking method involved the use of firewood on traditional three-stone cookstoves. These stoves are rudimentary and inefficient, leading to high fuel consumption and significant emissions. The reliance on non-renewable biomass fuels has also contributed to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis project aims to replace traditional three-stone stoves with improved cooking stoves (ICS) in Timor-Leste, thereby achieving significant GHG emission reductions and providing numerous additional benefits. Through a well-planned implementation schedule and the use of efficient technologies, the project will not only meet the thermal energy needs of the population but also contribute to environmental sustainability and improved public health."

        "section_name": "Baseline Emissions",
        "generation": "## Baseline Emissions\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Baseline Emissions\n\nThe quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes involves several key steps and methodological choices, all aimed at ensuring accuracy and reproducibility. Below, we outline the procedures, equations, and justifications used in this process.\n\n#### 1. Determination of Firewood Consumption (Bold)\n\nFirewood consumption is a critical parameter in estimating baseline emissions. For this project, the baseline firewood consumption (Bold) was determined using a baseline survey, which established Bold at 3.45 tonnes per stove annually. Alternatively, historical data or a default value of 0.5 ton/capita/year can be used if specific survey data is unavailable.\n\n#### 2. Efficiency of Cookstoves\n\nThe efficiency of both baseline and improved cookstoves significantly impacts the calculation of emissions reductions.\n\n- **Baseline Cookstove Efficiency (\u03b7old)**: Based on a water boiling test (WBT) survey, the efficiency of the baseline cookstove was determined to be 11.27%.\n- **Improved Cookstove Efficiency (\u03b7new,i,j)**: The efficiency of the improved cookstove is determined through similar testing methods.\n\n#### 3. Calculation of Woody Biomass Saved (By,savings,i,j)\n\nThe amount of woody biomass saved by using improved cookstoves is calculated using Equation 3 of VMR0006:\n\n\\[\nBy,savings,i,j = Bold \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{\u03b7old}{\u03b7new,i,j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( By,savings,i,j \\) = Woody biomass saved by improved cookstove type i and batch j.\n- \\( Bold \\) = Baseline firewood consumption.\n- \\( \u03b7old \\) = Efficiency of the baseline cookstove.\n- \\( \u03b7new,i,j \\) = Efficiency of the improved cookstove type i and batch j.\n\n#### 4. Fraction of Non-Renewable Biomass (fNRB)\n\nThe fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) is calculated using CDM Tool 30. For this project, fNRB is determined to be 76%.\n\n### Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\n\n#### 1. Estimation of Woody Biomass Saved\n\nThe estimation of woody biomass saved is done using the same Equation 3 of VMR0006 as mentioned above.\n\n#### 2. Calculation of Emission Reductions\n\nEmission reductions are calculated using the saved biomass, fNRB, net calorific value of wood fuel (NCVwood fuel), and emission factors for CO2 and non-CO2 gases. A net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to account for uncertainties. The relevant equation (Equation 2 of VMR0006) is:\n\n\\[\nERy,i,j = By,savings,i,j \\times fNRB,y \\times NCVwood fuel \\times (EFwf,CO2 + EFwf,non CO2) \\times Ny,i,j \\times 0.95\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ERy,i,j \\) = Emission reductions by improved cookstove type i and batch j during year y in t CO2e.\n- \\( By,savings,i,j \\) = Woody biomass saved.\n- \\( fNRB,y \\) = Fraction of non-renewable biomass.\n- \\( NCVwood fuel \\) = Net calorific value of wood fuel.\n- \\( EFwf,CO2 \\) and \\( EFwf,non CO2 \\) = Emission factors for CO2 and non-CO2 gases, respectively.\n- \\( Ny,i,j \\) = Number of improved cookstoves of type i and batch j.\n\n### Calculation of Baseline Emissions When Carbon Stock Increases Exceed Baseline Emissions\n\nIn cases where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions, baseline emissions may be negative. However, specific procedures for this scenario are not provided in the current methodology.\n\n### Specification of Reductions and Removals Separately\n\nNet GHG emission reductions are calculated using Equations 1 and 2 of VMR0006. The methodology allows for the separation of reductions and removals, ensuring clarity and precision in reporting.\n\n#### Relevant Equations\n\n1. **Equation 1 of VMR0006**:\n   \\[\n   ERy = \\sum \\sum ERy,i,j\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( ERy \\) = Emission reductions during year y in t CO2e.\n   - \\( ERy,i,j \\) = Emission reductions by improved cookstove type i and batch j during year y in t CO2e.\n\n2. **Equation 2 of VMR0006**:\n   \\[\n   ERy,i,j = By,savings,i,j \\times fNRB,y \\times NCVwood fuel \\times (EFwf,CO2 + EFwf,non CO2) \\times Ny,i,j \\times 0.95\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equation 3 of VMR0006**:\n   \\[\n   By,savings,i,j = Bold \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{\u03b7old}{\u03b7new,i,j}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equation 4 of Tool 30**:\n   \\[\n   RB = \\sum (MAIforest,i \\times (Fforest,i - Pforest,i)) + \\sum (MAIother,i \\times (Fother,i - Pother,i))\n   \\]\n\n5. **Equation 6 of VMR0006**:\n   \\[\n   Bold,adjusted = Bold \\times (1 - \u03bcy)\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( \u03bcy \\) = Baseline stove usage factor to account for use of baseline cookstoves along with improved cookstoves.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nSeveral methodological choices are made to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the calculations:\n\n- **Emission Factors and Default Values**: IPCC default values for wood fuel, such as net calorific value and CO2 emission factor, are used to ensure consistency and reliability.\n- **Survey Data**: Results from a water boiling test (WBT) survey are applied for ex-ante calculations.\n- **Tools and Models**: CDM Tool 30 is used to calculate fNRB values, and Tool 33 is used in conjunction with VMR0006 for sourcing default values to estimate baseline emissions where actual survey methods are not employed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis comprehensive procedure for quantifying baseline emissions and carbon stock changes ensures that all relevant factors are considered and accurately calculated. By following the outlined steps and utilizing the provided equations, the reader can reproduce the calculations and understand the methodological choices made in this project. All calculations are included in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet for transparency and validation."

These surveys gather data on the usage and condition of the improved cookstoves (ICS), the use of baseline stoves, and other relevant parameters. Data collection can be done manually or electronically and is compiled in a database for analysis. A sampling standard is used to determine the sample size to achieve 90/10 confidence precision, although a simplified approach may also be used. The project uses a default discount factor to account for efficiency loss of the project cookstove per year of operation. Additionally, the project applies IPCC default values for wood fuel and uses results from a water boiling test (WBT) survey for ex-ante calculations. The minimum sample size for the project's parameters is determined based on the target population size, following guidelines from VMR0006 and UNFCCC CDM Guidelines.\n\n### Purpose of Data\n\nThe primary purpose of the data is to facilitate the calculation of baseline emissions. This ensures that the project can accurately quantify the emissions reductions achieved through the implementation of improved cookstoves.\n\n### Comments\n\n- Appreciation for the project and its benefits such as reduced firewood usage, less smoke, and faster cooking.\n- Suggestions for better consultation and dissemination of information at the village level.\n- Concerns about the sustainability of the project and the inclusion of local industries.\n- Participants suggested extending the distribution of improved cookstoves to schools and rural areas.\n- No comments were received during the public comment period from 25/05/2023 to 24/06/2023.\n\nThis detailed documentation ensures transparency and accuracy in the data and parameters used for the project, supporting its credibility and effectiveness in reducing emissions."

This includes capturing the date of improved cookstove (ICS) distribution, location, beneficiary details, ICS specifics, usage information, and signed carbon waiver declaration agreements.\n2. **Recording**: Data will be meticulously recorded during kitchen observations, interviews with the primary cook, and through photographs of the cooking area with GPS coordinates.\n\n#### Storing\nAll collected data will be stored electronically in a secure database system. This system will include scanned copies of physical documents to ensure data integrity and accessibility.\n\n#### Aggregating and Collating\nData from field surveys will be compiled into a comprehensive database spreadsheet. This data will then be analyzed to identify trends, usage patterns, and overall project impact.\n\n#### Reporting\nBased on the analyzed data, monitoring reports will be developed either annually or biennially. These reports will provide insights into the project's progress and effectiveness.\n\n#### Calibration\nThe efficiency of the ICS will be monitored annually using a default discount factor to ensure accuracy and reliability of the data.\n\n### Organizational Structure, Responsibilities, and Competencies\n\n#### Team Composition\nA dedicated team, either internal or external to the project proponents, will be responsible for conducting the annual and biennial surveys. This team will include:\n- **Field Surveyors**: Responsible for collecting data through direct observations and interviews.\n- **Data Analysts**: Tasked with compiling and analyzing the data in the database.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n- **Field Surveyors**: Conduct kitchen observations, interviews, and take photographs with GPS coordinates.\n- **Data Analysts**: Compile the collected data into a database spreadsheet and perform thorough analysis.\n\n#### Local Collaborators\nLocal collaborators or ambassadors in the villages will play a crucial role in monitoring ICS usage and raising awareness among households about the project's benefits.\n\n### Procedures for Internal Auditing and QA/QC\n\n#### Standards\nThe sampling procedure will adhere to the UNFCCC\u2019s Standard for Sampling and Surveys for CDM project activities and programmes of activities Version 04.0. This ensures that the data collection and analysis process meets international quality standards.\n\n### Procedures for Handling Non-Conformances with the Validated Monitoring Plan\nWhile specific procedures for handling non-conformances are not detailed in the provided knowledge base, it is essential to establish a robust framework to address any deviations from the validated monitoring plan. This may include:\n- **Identification and Documentation**: Prompt identification and documentation of any non-conformances.\n- **Root Cause Analysis**: Conducting a thorough analysis to determine the root cause.\n- **Corrective Actions**: Implementing corrective actions to prevent recurrence.\n- **Review and Update**: Periodically reviewing and updating the monitoring plan to incorporate lessons learned.\n\n### Sampling Approaches Used\n\n#### Approach\nA simple random sampling approach will be utilized as per VMR0006 version 1.1, section 8.4 option (b).\n\n#### Sample Size\n- **Less than 300**: Sample size of 30\n- **Between 300 and 1000**: 10% of the group size\n- **More than 1000**: Sample size of 100\n\n#### Baseline Survey\nA baseline survey was conducted with 150 households in two municipalities (Dili and Aileu) to represent semi-urban and rural areas.\n\n#### Frequency of Measurement\nMeasurements will be taken at least once every two years to ensure the data remains current and relevant.\n\n#### QA/QC Procedures\nTo maintain data quality, lower bound values will be used if the desired precision is not met. The project will follow the UNFCCC CDM Guidelines for Sampling and Surveys for CDM Project Activities and Programmes of Activities, Version 04.0.\n\n### Line Diagrams for GHG Data Collection and Management System\nWhile specific line diagrams were not provided, it is recommended to develop visual representations of the GHG data collection and management system. These diagrams should illustrate the flow of data from collection to reporting, highlighting key processes and checkpoints for quality assurance.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis Monitoring Plan provides a comprehensive framework for systematically obtaining, recording, compiling, and analyzing data to ensure the project's success. By adhering to established standards and procedures, the project aims to maintain high data quality and integrity, ultimately contributing to its overall effectiveness and sustainability."
