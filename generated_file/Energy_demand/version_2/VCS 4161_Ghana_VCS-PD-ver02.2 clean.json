The existing cookstoves in the baseline scenario are three-stone fires or conventional systems lacking improved combustion air supply mechanisms and flue gas ventilation systems.\n\n**Methodology Procedure Steps**\n\nThe methodology for the project, as per methodology VMR0006, involves the installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves. Project activities include deploying Improved cookstoves with a specified high-power thermal efficiency of at least 25% based on manufacturer specifications. The project aims to supplant baseline scenarios where non-renewable wood fuel is utilized by the target population. The project encompasses steps such as user registration, data logging into the database, spot-checking by the Project Proponent, monitoring by the project implementer, and preparation of monitoring reports.\n\n**Key Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices**\n\nKey assumptions for the project encompass unbiased and reliable estimation of key variables over the crediting period with a confidence/precision level of 90/10, introduction of improved cookstoves as an energy efficiency measure, and considering the default value of leakage as 0.95.

Inconsistencies found during spot-checks are updated in the database, and regular audits are conducted throughout the project lifetime to maintain stove functionality.\n\n**Non-Conformance Handling:**\nProcedures for handling non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan involve data collection, distribution and monitoring database, spot checking of ICS, sample plan for the monitoring survey, data quality checks, consistency and duplication checks, and monitoring reporting to address any deviations from the plan.\n\n**Sampling Approaches and QA/QC Procedures:**\nSampling approaches include oversampling, buffer group sampling, drawing additional samples, and using lower confidence bounds. Simple Random Sampling is employed, with a sample size of 18 for each sampling unit. Field measurements through surveys monitor the number of stoves in use and the quantity of woody biomass used by project devices, with monitoring occurring at least once every two years.\n\n**Line Diagrams:**\nLine diagrams are utilized to display the GHG data collection and management system, providing a visual representation of the data flow and monitoring processes.\n\nBy following these structured methods and procedures, the project ensures robust data collection, analysis, and reporting for effective monitoring and evaluation of the monitored parameters."
