Step 2 focuses on verifying compliance with the positive list conditions. Notably, the methodology does not segregate baseline emissions but quantifies the net emission reductions achieved through the project.\n\n**Key Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices**\n\nKey assumptions underpinning the project include its voluntary nature, zero-cost installation of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) for households, and independence from government initiatives or multilateral funding. The methodology's design also excludes mandated government programs or policies promoting the distribution of fuel-efficient cookstoves in the host country.\n\nThe rationale behind project decisions is centered on the distribution of fuel-efficient ICS in Mozambique to replace traditional cookstoves, thereby mitigating indoor air pollution, conserving fuel resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and combating deforestation.\n\nMethodological choices aimed at ensuring precision and confidence in sampled parameters involve oversampling, buffer group sampling, and the use of lower or upper bounds of estimates when necessary. Monitoring of parameters ceases once the desired level of confidence is attained. The methodology strictly adheres to the activity method for demonstrating additionality, without deviations. Quality control and assurance mechanisms are in place to address non-sampling errors effectively.\n\n**References**\n\nNo relevant references were identified for this section."
