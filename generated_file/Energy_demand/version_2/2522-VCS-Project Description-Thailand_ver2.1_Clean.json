Effective measures for each parameter, such as oversampling, buffer groups, or using lower/upper bounds of estimates, are determined by the project proponent to achieve precision if reliability check requirements are not met.\n\n## Handling Non-Conformances\nHandling non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan involves ensuring high-quality, unbiased, and reliable information regarding the project's performance. This includes data collection procedures, maintaining a distribution and monitoring database, spot checking of ICS, implementing a sample plan for the monitoring survey, conducting data quality, consistency, and duplication checks, and submitting monitoring reports.\n\n## Sampling Approaches\nThe sampling plan includes oversampling and the use of a buffer group to ensure precision levels are met. Measures such as randomly drawing additional samples and collecting data from selected sources are employed. Outliers are identified and addressed by examining data points with values greater than three standard deviations from the mean of the sample.\n\n## Line Diagrams\nNo specific information on line diagrams was provided in the key info.\n\nIn conclusion, the detailed process and schedule for obtaining, recording, compiling, and analyzing monitored data and parameters outlined in this document aim to ensure accuracy, reliability, and compliance with monitoring requirements.
