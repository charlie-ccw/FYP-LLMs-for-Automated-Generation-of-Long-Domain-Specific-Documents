However, the baseline scenario can be inferred as the equivalent generation of thermal energy using firewood in three stone open fires to fulfill the cooking energy demand in the absence of the project activity.\n\n**Procedure and Outcome**\n\nAs the methodology procedure steps are not specified, it can be understood that the baseline scenario is established based on the prevailing practice of using firewood in three stone open fires for cooking purposes. The outcome of this step results in the identification of the baseline against which the project's emission reductions are measured.\n\n**Key Assumptions and Rationale**\n\nThe key assumptions underlying the project include the utilization of firewood in traditional cooking methods and the absence of specific laws or policies in Vietnam mandating the adoption of improved cook stoves. The rationale for these assumptions is rooted in the prevalent practice of using three stone open fires for cooking, which the project aims to address by introducing improved cook stoves.\n\n**Methodological Choices**\n\nGiven that the project falls under a CDM registered GHG program, specific methodological choices are not outlined. However, reference is made to section 3.20.5 of the VCS Standard V4.3 for guidance on methodology related to the project.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe baseline scenario in the context of the CDM registered GHG program under CDM-PoA 10477 involves the use of firewood in traditional cooking methods as the reference point for emission reductions.
