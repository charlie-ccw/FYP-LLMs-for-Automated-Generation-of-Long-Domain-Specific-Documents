Baseline emissions may be negative if carbon stock increases, such as sinks, exceed baseline emissions.\n\n**Calculating Emission Reductions:**\n\nThe methodology for quantification involves the following formula to calculate emission reductions by improved cook stoves:\n\nEmission reductions by improved cook stove = Quantity of woody biomass saved * Fraction of woody biomass that is non-renewable * Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass * (CO2 emission factor for wood fuel + CO2 emission factor for non-CO2) * Number of stoves * 0.95\n\n**Relevant Equations:**\n\n- Quantity of woody biomass saved per stove\n- Fraction of woody biomass considered non-renewable\n- Net calorific value of the non-renewable biomass\n- CO2 emission factor for wood fuel\n- CO2 emission factor for non-CO2\n\n**Reproducing Calculations:**\n\nTo accurately replicate the calculations, the fNRB value can be determined by calculating the share of renewable and non-renewable woody biomass in the total quantity of wood biomass consumption for the project area. The fNRB value was calculated based on scientific literature, specifically from Bailis et al. (2015), for the geographical boundary of India.\n\n**Methodological Choices:**\n\nThe methodology justifies the selection of emission factors and default values by outlining the sampling methodology, objectives, data collection methods, and procedures to avoid double counting of emission reductions. The applicability of tool 30 for calculating project-specific values for fNRB and the selection of geographical boundaries for biomass sourcing are also justified.\n\n**Inclusion in Spreadsheet:**\n\nAll calculations, including the formula for emission reductions by improved cook stoves, quantities of woody biomass saved per stove, fraction of woody biomass considered non-renewable, net calorific value of the non-renewable biomass, and CO2 emission factor for fossil fuels used for substitution, must be documented in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet.\n\nBy following these steps and equations, the quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes can be accurately carried out, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in the calculations."
