The implementation of the project includes the distribution of ICS to end-users, data collection at distribution points, maintenance of distribution records, and the establishment of a monitoring plan to track project performance and outcomes.\n\n**Technologies/Measures Implemented**\n\nThe primary technology/measure implemented in the project is the introduction of Improved Cookstoves (ICS) to replace conventional stoves. The ICS aims to enhance energy efficiency and decrease reliance on non-renewable biomass for combustion. The project ensures monitoring of fuel consumption, prohibits the use of briquettes or processed wood, and employs a record-keeping system with unique device identification to prevent double counting of emissions.\n\n**Project Location**\n\nThe project is situated in various districts within the Analamanga region of the Republic of Madagascar.\n\n**GHG Emission Reductions Explanation**\n\nTo generate GHG emission reductions, the project employs measures to prevent double counting by allowing only the project proponent to claim emission reductions. Agreements with individual households/users and a meticulous record-keeping system are utilized to track each Improved Cookstove (ICS) within the project activity.\n\n**Pre-Implementation Scenario**\n\nPrior to the project implementation, the rural areas in the host country heavily relied on woody biomass as the primary fuel source for cooking since 1989. This trend persisted over time, highlighting the community's dependence on biomass for meeting their cooking energy needs.\n\n**Estimates of Emission Reductions**\n\nThe project is estimated to achieve an annual average reduction of 313,237 tCO2e through the decreased usage of non-renewable wood fuel. Total reductions are currently not available.\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, detailing the technologies/measures implemented, project location, emission reduction mechanisms, pre-implementation scenario, and estimated reductions."

The technologies employed include unique serial-coded ICS, with distribution records to prevent double counting of emission reductions. The project involves signing end-user agreements with individual households to establish ownership of the emission reductions generated by the stoves, ensuring that only the project proponent can claim the reductions.\n\nThe implementation schedule includes collecting and recording user information at distribution points, transferring it to an electronic database regularly, and maintaining distribution records. A Monitoring Plan is in place, encompassing project database management, spot checks of ICS, a sample plan for monitoring surveys, data quality checks, and monitoring reporting to track emission reductions effectively.\n\n**Main Manufacturing/Production Technologies and Equipment**\n\nThe main manufacturing/production technologies involved in the project are Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) with an average lifetime of 5.5 years based on industry standards. The initial efficiency of the project stove is 0.34. These stoves provide essential services such as improved cooking efficiency and reduced fuel consumption, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project ensures that the same services provided by the ICS would have been supplied in the baseline scenario, where non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) was used to meet similar thermal energy needs.\n\n**Relation to Other Equipment and Systems**\n\nTo prevent double counting of emission reductions, the project includes procedures like signing agreements with households and maintaining distribution records. Additionally, monitoring elements like project database management, spot checks of ICS, and data quality checks are in place to ensure accurate tracking of emission reductions. The project's services are linked to the baseline scenario through the replacement of traditional stoves with ICS, improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.\n\n**Existing Scenario Facilities, Systems, and Equipment**\n\nPrior to the project implementation, the existing scenario involved the use of biomass residues as fuel, energy efficiency measures like ICS, and a record-keeping system with unique identifications to avoid double counting of emissions. The project builds upon this existing infrastructure to transition towards cleaner and more sustainable cooking practices, thereby reducing GHG emissions and contributing to environmental conservation.\n\nIn conclusion, the project activity with its specific technologies and measures is designed to achieve significant GHG emission reductions by promoting the adoption of Improved Cook Stoves, enhancing energy efficiency, and providing sustainable cooking solutions to households. The implementation schedule and monitoring mechanisms ensure the effective tracking of emission reductions and the successful execution of the project objectives."

The project's primary purpose is to reduce smoke emissions, increase fuel efficiency, and enhance overall health by replacing traditional cooking methods with improved cookstoves.\n\n**Prior Conditions**\n\nBefore the project initiation, the target population relied on non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) for their cooking needs. The project has not been implemented to generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction. The baseline scenario reflects the continued use of firewood by the community to meet thermal energy needs similar to those provided by the project cookstoves in the absence of project activity.\n\n**Stakeholder Engagement**\n\nStakeholders involved in the project include representatives from the local community in Madagascar who depend on firewood for cooking fuel. They participated in a meeting where the project activity was explained, and their questions and concerns were addressed.\n\n**Project Duration and Funding**\n\nThe project has a fixed crediting period of 10 years, starting from 15-August-2022 to 14-August-2032. Funding for the project comes from voluntary initiatives and is not intended to meet any local laws or regulatory compliances. The project participants have committed to not claiming GHG emission reduction credits under any other emission-trading program or GHG binding limits for the given crediting period.\n\n**Monitoring and Reporting**\n\nA comprehensive Monitoring Plan is in place for the project, ensuring high-quality, unbiased, and reliable information for calculating Verified Emission Reductions (VERs) based on the non-renewable biomass saved by the Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) in the project activity. The plan includes project database management, spot checks of ICS, a sample plan for monitoring surveys, data quality checks, and monitoring reporting.\n\n**Environmental and Social Impact**\n\nThe Cookstove Project in Madagascar aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing traditional cookstoves with fuel-efficient Improved Cook Stoves. This initiative will lead to a decrease in emissions and prevent double counting of emission reductions through a robust record-keeping system. The project also addresses the social impact by improving health outcomes and providing better cooking solutions to the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the Cookstove Project in Madagascar has been carefully designed to address environmental, social, and health challenges by promoting sustainable cooking practices and reducing GHG emissions without generating emissions for subsequent reduction."
