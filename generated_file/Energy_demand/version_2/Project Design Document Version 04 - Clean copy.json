The baseline scenario serves as a crucial reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of the project's interventions and measuring its impact on sustainable fuel wood utilization.\n\n**Methodological Approach and Procedure**\n\nThe methodology adopted for the project involves the replacement of traditional cook stoves with improved cook stoves to enhance energy efficiency. This initiative falls under small-scale methodologies, aligning with AMS-II.G, and targets 14,046 individual households in specific districts of Maharashtra. The procedural steps encompass the systematic deployment of improved cook stoves to promote energy conservation and mitigate environmental degradation.\n\n**Key Assumptions and Rationale**\n\nKey assumptions underpinning the project include the recognition of the demand-supply gap for sustainably extractable fuel wood, exacerbated by population growth and forest conversion. The project's adherence to AMS-II.G criteria is substantiated by the project's scope, focusing on households utilizing efficient cook stoves in designated districts. The rationale for these choices is rooted in the project's objective to improve clean cooking practices, reduce health risks from indoor air pollution, and foster sustainable energy consumption among marginalized communities in Maharashtra.\n\n**Methodological Choices and References**\n\nThe selection of AMS-II.G methodology for the project is justified by its compatibility with the project's objectives and target beneficiaries. The references supporting the assumptions, rationale, and methodological decisions can be accessed in the Project Design Document Version 04, specifically in the sections detailing the quantification of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals.\n\nBy meticulously following the prescribed methodology and substantiating key assumptions and choices, the project aims to make a tangible impact on promoting sustainable energy practices and improving the well-being of vulnerable communities in Maharashtra."
