        "generation": "**Project Summary**\n\nThe project aims to distribute 50,000 Improved Cook Stoves to domestic households in rural areas of Banaskantha, India. These cookstoves are designed to be energy-efficient, reducing the reliance on non-renewable firewood for cooking purposes. Additionally, the project includes planting 25 trees in the school of every village where the cookstoves are distributed, serving as a carbon sink and aligning with SDG-13 Climate Action goals.\n\n**Technologies/Measures Implemented**\n\nThe primary technology implemented in the project is the distribution of Improved Cook Stoves to rural households. These cookstoves offer higher thermal efficiency compared to traditional stoves, leading to a significant reduction in the consumption of non-renewable firewood and, consequently, a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Project Location**\n\nThe project is located in Banaskantha, India, with geographical coordinates 24.345474\u00b0N, 71.762248\u00b0E. The initiative targets rural areas where the use of firewood for cooking purposes is prevalent, aiming to transition households towards cleaner and more sustainable cooking options.\n\n**GHG Emission Reductions Explanation**\n\nBy providing energy-efficient cookstoves to rural households, the project anticipates a notable decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. The Improved Cook Stoves are expected to replace traditional stoves, leading to reduced reliance on non-renewable firewood and, consequently, a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n**Pre-Implementation Scenario**\n\nPrior to the project implementation, the baseline scenario involved the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) or fossil fuel by the target population to fulfill their thermal energy needs. The project seeks to disrupt this scenario by introducing cleaner and more sustainable cooking alternatives.\n\n**Estimated Reductions and Removals**\n\nThe project is estimated to save an average of 335,725 tonnes of CO2 annually, with a total estimated GHG emission reduction or removal of 2,350,075 tCO2e over its lifetime. These reductions showcase the significant impact of transitioning rural households to energy-efficient cookstoves and implementing carbon sink trees in the project's target villages."

This scenario is justified based on the population of scheduled tribes residing in the rural area of Banaskantha district.\n\n**Methodology and Procedure Steps**\n\nThe methodology applied for the project is VMR0006 - Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves, Version 1.1. This methodology includes steps such as utilizing 'TOOL30: Calculation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass' and is supported by the distribution of Improved Cookstoves (ICS) to domestic households in rural areas.\n\n**Key Assumptions**\n\nThe key assumptions for the project encompass the distribution of 50,000 improved cookstoves, resulting in an average annual CO2 savings of 335,725 tonnes. Furthermore, the initiative involves planting 25 trees in the school of each village where the cookstoves are distributed to serve as a carbon sink. The project assumes no adverse environmental impacts have been identified, hence omitting the need for an environmental impact assessment.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe rationale behind the project decisions revolves around creating employment opportunities for rural individuals through activities like data collection, transportation, distribution, and maintenance of improved cookstoves. Additionally, the distribution of cookstoves and tree planting in schools contribute to economic growth (SDG-8) and climate action (SDG-13) by mitigating CO2 emissions and establishing carbon sinks.\n\n**Methodological Choices**\n\nThe selected methodology for the project is VMR0006 - Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves, Version 1.1, with Sectoral Scope 03, and utilizing TOOL30 for calculations.
