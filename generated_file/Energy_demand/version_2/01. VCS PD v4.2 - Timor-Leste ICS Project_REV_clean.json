        "generation": "**Project Summary**\n\nThe project involves the distribution of 200,000 jumbo-stove type Improved Cookstoves (ICS) throughout Timor-Leste. These ICS aim to reduce CO2 emissions by replacing traditional three-stone cookstoves with more efficient alternatives that require less firewood. The project also considers allowing the continued use of traditional cookstoves alongside the new ICS.\n\n**Technologies/Measures Implemented**\n\nThe technologies implemented by the project include the introduction and utilization of 200,000 ICS to reduce CO2 emissions. These ICS are designed to replace traditional cookstoves, leading to a decrease in the consumption of firewood. The project also accounts for the potential coexistence of traditional cookstoves with the new ICS.\n\n**Location of the Project**\n\nThe project will be carried out in various municipalities across Timor-Leste, including Dili (suburbs), Manatuto, Aileu, Ermera, Likisa, Ainaro, Laut\u00e9m, Viqueque, Baucau, Ambeno, Atauro, Manufahi, Bobonaro, and Covalima.\n\n**Expected GHG Emission Reductions**\n\nThe project is expected to generate greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals through quantification and monitoring of the reductions. The estimated annual GHG emission reductions/removals amount to 507,463 tCO2e annually. Over a ten-year period, the total estimated emission reductions from the project are projected to reach 5,074,630 tCO2e.\n\n**Prior Scenario**\n\nPrior to the implementation of the project, no specific scenario is outlined in the provided information regarding the existing conditions related to the use of traditional cookstoves and the associated greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBy implementing the distribution of Improved Cookstoves, the project aims to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and promote sustainable cooking practices across Timor-Leste, contributing to the mitigation of climate change and environmental conservation."

By implementing improved cookstoves, the project will significantly reduce smoke emissions and improve indoor air quality. The technologies implemented will focus on reducing CO2 emissions and preventing deforestation. This project is strategically located in Timor-Leste to address the specific needs of the community and environment in this region.\n\n**Expected Sustainable Development Contributions:**\n\nThe project's primary goal is to enhance the well-being of the community by replacing traditional cookstoves with improved ones. The improved cookstoves release less smoke, resulting in better indoor air quality. This improvement is expected to prevent acute respiratory diseases and enhance pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, by reducing the need for firewood collection, the project will alleviate the time burden on women and girls, enabling them to pursue education and empowerment opportunities.\n\n**Contribution to National Sustainable Development Priorities:**\n\nThe Timor-Leste ICS Project aligns with the national sustainable development priorities by contributing to Goal 13, which focuses on combating climate change impacts. By integrating climate change measures into national policies and strategies, the project addresses the urgent need for environmental conservation. Additionally, the project supports Goal 15 by promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Through the replacement of traditional cookstoves with improved ones, the project ensures the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of forests in Timor-Leste.\n\n**Monitoring and Reporting Provisions:**\n\nTo track the project's sustainable development contributions, provisions have been made to replace 200,000 traditional three-stone cookstoves with improved cookstoves. Monitoring activities will focus on reducing smoke emissions, improving indoor air quality, preventing respiratory diseases, and alleviating the time burden on women and girls for firewood collection. Reporting on the project's achievements will highlight the positive outcomes, including reduced smoke emissions, improved health outcomes, and increased opportunities for education and empowerment within the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the Timor-Leste ICS Project is a vital initiative that not only addresses environmental concerns but also prioritizes the well-being and empowerment of the local community. By implementing improved cookstoves and promoting sustainable practices, the project contributes significantly to sustainable development goals and national priorities in Timor-Leste."

This reduction serves as the basis for estimating baseline emissions, which may be negative in cases where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions.\n\nThe methodology does not provide separate specifications for reductions and removals but quantifies emission reductions based on the reduction in non-renewable biomass fuel consumption in the efficient project stoves compared to baseline stoves.\n\n**Equations and Calculations**\n\nTo reproduce the calculations, the following equations are utilized:\n\n**Equation 1:** Baseline Emissions = Non-renewable biomass fuel consumption in baseline stoves - Non-renewable biomass fuel consumption in project stoves.\n\n**Equation 2:** Estimated Emission Reduction = (Baseline Emissions x Emission Factor x Default Value) / 100\n\n**Equation 3:** Total Carbon Stock Changes = (Baseline Emissions x Carbon Stock Change Factor) - (Estimated Emission Reduction x Carbon Stock Change Factor)\n\nThe methodology justifies the methodological choices by using IPCC default values for wood fuel and fixed values for the entire crediting period. This includes using a fixed value of 11.27% for the WBT survey conducted on three-stone fire systems using firewood.\n\n**Reproducing Calculations**\n\nTo reproduce the calculations, a sampling standard is employed to determine the sample size for monitoring data surveys to achieve a 90/10 confidence precision level. The calculations are based on values from the distribution plan and are meticulously documented in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet, adhering to the VCS Version 4.2 guidelines.\n\nBy following the specified equations and methodological choices, stakeholders can accurately quantify baseline emissions and carbon stock changes, enabling a comprehensive assessment of emission reductions and removals within the specified framework."
