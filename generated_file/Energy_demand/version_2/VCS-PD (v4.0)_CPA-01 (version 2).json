This project aims to contribute to sustainable development by addressing various environmental and social well-being challenges. The ICS technology utilized is a single pot improved cookstove made of clay liner and insulated with an outer metal sheet, designed to increase airflow and improve cooking efficiency. The project location is situated at Latitude: 21\u00b027'24.22\" S and Longitude: 47\u00b05'4.05\" E.\n\n**Project Activities and Sustainable Development Contributions**\n\nThe project activities encompass the distribution and promotion of the Soarehitra improved Cookstove to rural households reliant on fuelwood for cooking. By implementing this technology, the project aims to achieve sustainable development contributions by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, preventing indoor air pollution, protecting forests, mitigating fire hazards, and decreasing the workload associated with collecting firewood. These efforts contribute to ecological balance and social harmony in the region.\n\n**Expected Sustainable Development Contributions**\n\nThe implementation of the Soarehitra improved Cookstove is expected to result in significant environmental and social well-being benefits. These include reductions in GHG emissions, prevention of indoor air pollution, protection of forests, prevention of fire hazards, and reduction of workload for collecting firewood. These contributions are essential for promoting sustainable development and improving the overall quality of life for local communities.\n\n**Alignment with National Sustainable Development Priorities**\n\nThe Madagascar Improved Cookstove Project aligns with nationally stated sustainable development priorities by focusing on economic well-being, gender equality, and poverty reduction. The project provides employment opportunities, promotes better living conditions, and addresses gender disparities in the region. By supporting these priorities, the project contributes to the overall sustainable development goals of the country.\n\n**Monitoring and Reporting Provisions**\n\nThe project includes provisions for monitoring and reporting its sustainable development contributions. Monitoring activities will track reductions in GHG emissions, natural recovery of forests, decrease in indoor air pollution, improved ecological balance, protection of standing forests, prevention of fire hazards, and preservation of wood resources. Reporting will highlight environmental benefits such as GHG emission reductions, indoor air pollution prevention, and forest protection, as well as social benefits like wood resource preservation and reduced workload for firewood collection.\n\nIn conclusion, the Madagascar Improved Cookstove Project by KCM is a vital initiative that not only introduces efficient cooking technologies but also contributes significantly to sustainable development by addressing environmental challenges and promoting social well-being in the region."

It is important to note that any future deviations will be thoroughly justified and supported by evidence to demonstrate that they do not negatively impact the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals.\n\n**Previous Deviations:**\n\nThere have been no previous deviations from the methodology for the project \"project_name.\"\n\n**Impact on Conservativeness:**\n\nAny potential future deviations will be carefully evaluated to ensure that they do not compromise the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals.\n\n**Criteria and Procedures for Monitoring or Measurement:**\n\nIn the absence of current deviations, it is confirmed that any deviations in the future will relate only to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement and will not impact other parts of the methodology.\n\n**Evidence Provided:**\n\nThe evidence provided supports the deviation by confirming that the project is a voluntary initiative and is not under any mandatory/compliance scheme of the host country, Madagascar. This ensures transparency and accountability in the project's implementation.\n\n**Approval Status:**\n\nThe project has been approved by the Designated National Authority (DNA) of Madagascar, as evidenced by an authorization letter dated 17 Oct 2018. This approval confirms the project as a voluntary initiative not under any mandatory/compliance scheme of the host country.\n\n**Approving Authority:**\n\nThe Designated National Authority (DNA) of Madagascar, represented by Mr. Thomas Winklehner, has approved the project, underscoring its compliance with regulatory requirements and voluntary nature.\n\nIn conclusion, while no methodology deviations have been identified to date, the project team is committed to justifying any future deviations and ensuring that they do not compromise the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals. Adherence to monitoring and measurement criteria will be upheld, and evidence will be provided to support any deviations that may arise in the future."
