        "generation": "### Project Summary\n\n#### 1. Summary Description of Technologies/Measures\nThe project aims to enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Republic of Gambia by distributing and installing approximately 300,000 fuel-efficient improved cookstoves (ICS). These stoves, specifically the single pot TLC-CQC Rocket Stoves, will replace the traditional three-stone firewood stoves commonly used by households. The ICS are designed to burn wood more efficiently, thereby improving thermal transfer to pots, conserving fuel, reducing indoor air pollution, and decreasing the time spent collecting firewood. Additionally, the project seeks to mitigate deforestation in Gambia. Each household will receive two ICS at no cost, and the project will leverage carbon finance to recover its implementation expenses.\n\n#### 2. Location of the Project\nThe project will be implemented within the geographical boundaries of the Republic of Gambia.\n\n#### 3. GHG Emission Reductions or Carbon Dioxide Removals\nThe distribution of fuel-efficient ICS is expected to significantly reduce GHG emissions by replacing the traditional open fire cooking method. The new stoves burn wood more efficiently, leading to better thermal transfer and reduced fuel consumption. This switch will lower greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the reliance on non-renewable wood fuel. The estimated GHG emission reduction for a single stove per year is 7.0 t CO2e. On average, the project is anticipated to reduce GHG emissions by 1,016,067 t CO2e annually, amounting to a total reduction of 10,160,672 t CO2e over the project's 10-year crediting period.\n\n#### 4. Scenario Prior to Project Implementation\nBefore the project, the target population in Gambia relied on non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) to meet their thermal energy needs. They used inefficient three-stone fires or conventional stoves that lacked advanced combustion air supply mechanisms and flue gas ventilation systems. These traditional cooking methods resulted in higher wood fuel consumption and elevated GHG emissions, contributing to environmental degradation and health hazards due to indoor smoke pollution.\n\n#### 5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals\nThe project is expected to achieve an average annual GHG emission reduction of 1,016,067 t CO2e. Over the entire 10-year crediting period, the total GHG emission reduction is projected to be 10,160,672 t CO2e.\n\nThis comprehensive approach not only addresses environmental concerns but also improves the quality of life for the local population by providing a cleaner, more efficient cooking solution."

The methodology focuses on calculating net emission reductions achieved by the project rather than accounting for baseline emissions separately. Here, we detail the steps involved, relevant equations, and methodological choices to ensure accurate and reproducible calculations.\n\n### Quantification of Baseline Emissions\n\nThe methodology does not provide a separate account for baseline emissions. Instead, it quantifies the net emission reductions achieved by the project.
