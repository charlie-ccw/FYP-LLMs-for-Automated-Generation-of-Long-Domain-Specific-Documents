The initiative has been approved as a voluntary project and does not fall under any mandatory compliance schemes within the country.\n\n### Systematic Enforcement of Laws\n- **If the project is located inside a Non-Annex 1 country and the project activities are mandated by a law, statute, or other regulatory framework, are such laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks systematically enforced?**\n  - \u2610 Yes\n  - \u2610 No\n  - \u2611 Not Applicable\n\nSince there are no mandated laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks requiring the project activities in Madagascar, the question of systematic enforcement does not apply.\n\n### Evidence of Systematic Non-Enforcement\nAs there are no mandated laws, statutes, or other regulatory frameworks requiring the project activities related to the dissemination of improved cook stoves in Madagascar, there is no need to provide evidence of systematic non-enforcement. Existing policies, such as the Electricity Access and Poverty Reduction Strategy under the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), do not mandate these project activities. Additionally, the decree on the 'Compatibility of Investments and Environment' confirms that cook stove projects are not required to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment.\n\n## Additionality Methods\n\n### Application of Methodology or Tool\nThe applied methodology or tool to demonstrate additionality involves several steps. Each step is meticulously documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results. However, specific steps and outcomes are derived from the registered PoA-DD and will be detailed in the subsequent sections.\n\n### Method Selected to Demonstrate Additionality\nThe method selected to demonstrate additionality for this project is the **Barrier Analysis** method. This method identifies and justifies the barriers that prevent the project from being implemented without the support of the carbon finance mechanism.\n\n### Barrier Analysis\nThe barrier analysis identifies several relevant barriers that justify the additionality of the project:\n\n1. **Financial Barriers:**\n   - High upfront costs for the production and distribution of improved cook stoves.\n   - Limited access to affordable financing options for both producers and consumers.\n\n2. **Technological Barriers:**\n   - Lack of technical expertise and infrastructure to produce and maintain improved cook stoves.\n   - Limited availability of high-quality materials required for the manufacturing process.\n\n3. **Market Barriers:**\n   - Low market penetration due to lack of awareness and acceptance of improved cook stoves among the local population.\n   - Competition with traditional and cheaper cooking methods that are deeply ingrained in the cultural practices.\n\nEach of these barriers is substantiated with key facts and assumptions. For instance, financial barriers are evident from the high cost of raw materials and the limited access to microfinance institutions in rural areas. Technological barriers are highlighted by the absence of local manufacturers with the capability to produce high-quality cook stoves. Market barriers are demonstrated through surveys indicating low awareness levels and preference for traditional cooking methods.\n\n### Performance Method\nTo demonstrate that the project can achieve performance levels at least equivalent to the performance benchmark metric, the project has been designed to meet or exceed the efficiency standards set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. Detailed performance metrics and benchmarks are provided in Section C of the registered PoA-DD.\n\n### Activity Method\nConformance with the positive list is demonstrated in the Applicability of Methodology section above. This ensures that the project activities align with the predefined criteria for additionality.\n\n### Sufficient Information for Reproduction of Analysis\nTo ensure transparency and reproducibility, all relevant data and parameters, along with their sources, are provided. This includes financial models, market surveys, and performance benchmarks. Detailed information can be referred to in Section C of the registered PoA-DD, allowing any reader to reproduce the additionality analysis and obtain consistent results.\n\nBy adhering to the applied methodology and relevant tools, the project demonstrates clear additionality, ensuring that it provides genuine and measurable environmental benefits beyond business-as-usual scenarios."

This involves determining the total amount of GHG emissions reduced before accounting for leakage.\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Emission Reductions} = \\text{Baseline Emissions} - \\text{Project Emissions} \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Applying the Leakage Adjustment Factor\nNext, apply the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to the gross emission reductions to account for leakage. This step ensures that the potential indirect emissions caused by the project are considered.\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Emission Reductions} = \\text{Gross Emission Reductions} \\times 0.95 \\]\n\n### Relevant Equations\nThe key equation for quantifying leakage emissions is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Emission Reductions} = (\\text{Baseline Emissions} - \\text{Project Emissions}) \\times 0.95 \\]\n\nThis equation incorporates the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 as specified in the CDM Methodology AMS-II.G.\n\n### Methodological Choices and Justifications\n#### Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values\nThe selection of the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is based on the CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. This factor is a standardized value that simplifies the calculation process by eliminating the need for additional surveys or separate leakage management. The choice of this factor is justified by its acceptance and validation within the CDM framework, ensuring consistency and reliability in leakage quantification.\n\n### Reproducing the Calculations\nTo reproduce the calculations, follow these steps:\n1. **Determine Baseline Emissions**: Calculate the emissions that would have occurred in the absence of the project.\n2. **Determine Project Emissions**: Calculate the emissions occurring as a result of the project.\n3. **Calculate Gross Emission Reductions**: Subtract the project emissions from the baseline emissions.\n4. **Apply the Leakage Adjustment Factor**: Multiply the gross emission reductions by 0.95 to account for leakage.\n\n### Example Calculation\nFor illustrative purposes, consider a project with the following estimates:\n- Baseline Emissions: 100,000 tCO2e per year\n- Project Emissions: 60,000 tCO2e per year\n\n1. **Gross Emission Reductions**:\n   \\[ 100,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} - 60,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} = 40,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n2. **Net Emission Reductions**:\n   \\[ 40,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\times 0.95 = 38,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n### Inclusion in Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet\nInclude the calculations in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet by listing the estimated GHG emission reductions or removals (in tCO2e) for each year of the project. For example:\n\n| Year          | Estimated Reduction (tCO2e) |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| 09/10/2018 - 08/10/2019 | 37,722 |\n| 09/10/2019 - 08/10/2020 | 37,722 |\n| ...           | ...                         |\n| 09/10/2027 - 08/10/2028 | 37,722 |\n\n### Conclusion\nThis document provides a comprehensive procedure for quantifying leakage emissions, including all relevant equations and methodological justifications. By following the outlined steps and applying the default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95, accurate and reliable quantification of leakage emissions can be achieved."

        "generation": "# Quantification of Estimated GHG Emission Reductions and Carbon Dioxide Removals\n\n## Procedure Overview\n\nThis section outlines the procedure for quantifying the estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions (reductions) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removals (removals). The calculations are based on the methodologies specified, incorporating all relevant equations and data parameters. The procedure is designed to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the calculations.\n\n## Equations for Quantification\n\nThe quantification process involves several key equations that are applied to estimate reductions and removals. Each equation is detailed below to enable the reader to reproduce the calculations.\n\n### 1. Baseline Emissions Calculation\n\nThe baseline emissions represent the GHG emissions that would have occurred in the absence of the project. The equation to calculate baseline emissions (BE) is:\n\n\\[ BE = \\sum (A_i \\times EF_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for source \\( i \\) (e.g., amount of fuel consumed)\n- \\( EF_i \\) = Emission factor for source \\( i \\) (e.g., CO2 emitted per unit of fuel)\n\n### 2. Project Emissions Calculation\n\nProject emissions (PE) are the GHG emissions occurring as a result of the project activities. The equation is:\n\n\\[ PE = \\sum (A_i \\times EF_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for project source \\( i \\)\n- \\( EF_i \\) = Emission factor for project source \\( i \\)\n\n### 3. Leakage Emissions Calculation\n\nLeakage emissions (LE) are the GHG emissions that occur outside the project boundary due to the project activities. The equation is:\n\n\\[ LE = \\sum (A_i \\times EF_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for leakage source \\( i \\)\n- \\( EF_i \\) = Emission factor for leakage source \\( i \\)\n\n### 4. GHG Emission Reductions Calculation\n\nThe GHG emission reductions (ER) are calculated by subtracting the project and leakage emissions from the baseline emissions:\n\n\\[ ER = BE - (PE + LE) \\]\n\n### 5. Carbon Dioxide Removals Calculation\n\nCarbon dioxide removals (CR) are calculated based on the amount of CO2 sequestered by the project activities. The equation is:\n\n\\[ CR = \\sum (A_i \\times SR_i) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A_i \\) = Activity data for removal activity \\( i \\)\n- \\( SR_i \\) = Sequestration rate for removal activity \\( i \\)\n\n## Data and Parameters Monitored\n\nThe data and parameter values used in the calculations are derived from Section 5.2. These values are crucial for accurate quantification and include:\n\n- Activity data (e.g., fuel consumption, biomass growth)\n- Emission factors (e.g., CO2 per unit of fuel)\n- Sequestration rates (e.g., CO2 sequestered per unit of biomass)\n\n## Example Calculations\n\nTo illustrate the application of the equations, we provide example calculations for a given vintage period.\n\n### Example Vintage Period: DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY\n\n#### Baseline Emissions\n\\[ BE = 50,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### Project Emissions\n\\[ PE = 20,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### Leakage Emissions\n\\[ LE = 10,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### GHG Emission Reductions\n\\[ ER = 50,000 - (20,000 + 10,000) = 20,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n#### Carbon Dioxide Removals\n\\[ CR = 10,000 \\, \\text{tCO2e} \\]\n\n### Summary Table for Non-Permanence Risk Assessment\n\nFor projects required to assess permanence risk, the following table summarizes the estimated values:\n\n| Vintage Period         | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | 50,000                               | 20,000                               | 10,000                              | 4,000                                     | 8,000                            | 8,000                           | 16,000                                 |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                           |                                  |                                 |                                        |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                           |                                  |                                 |                                        |\n| Total                  |                                      |                                      |                                     |                                           |                                  |                                 |                                        |\n\n### Summary Table for Non-Permanence Risk Rating\n\n| Non-Permanence Risk Rating (%) | Example: 20% |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| Has the non-permanence risk report been attached as either an appendix or a separate document? | \u2611 Yes \u2610 No |\n| For ARR and IFM projects with harvesting, state, in tCO2e, the Long-term Average (LTA). | Example: 300,000 tCO2e |\n| Has the LTA been updated based on monitored data, if applicable? | \u2611 Yes \u2610 No |\n| State, in tCO2e, the expected total GHG benefit to date. | 377,220 tCO2e |\n| Is the number of GHG credits issued below the LTA? | \u2611 Yes \u2610 No |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe detailed procedure and equations provided in this document enable the accurate quantification of GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals.
