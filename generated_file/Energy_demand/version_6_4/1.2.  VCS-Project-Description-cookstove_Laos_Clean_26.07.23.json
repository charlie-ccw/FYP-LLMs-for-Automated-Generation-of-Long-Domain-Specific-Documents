This section outlines these deviations, provides justifications for their application, and presents evidence to demonstrate that they do not compromise the conservativeness of the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals. Additionally, it confirms that these deviations pertain solely to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement.\n\n### Deviation 1: Confidence Interval Adjustment\n\n**Description:** \nWe have opted to use the lower bound of the 90% or 95% confidence interval of the parameter value as an alternative when the required 90/10 or 95/10 precision is not achieved during sampling.\n\n**Justification:** \nThis deviation ensures that even when the precision criteria are not met, the data remains robust and reliable. By using the lower bound of the confidence interval, we maintain a conservative estimate, thus safeguarding the integrity of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification.\n\n**Evidence:** \n- The application of a single sampling plan covering a grouped project with 95/10 confidence/precision for the sample size calculation ensures that the deviation does not negatively impact the conservativeness of the quantification.\n- This approach aligns with the standard sampling and survey requirements for CDM project activities and programs, ensuring compliance and reliability.\n- Representative sampling will be conducted in accordance with the applied methodology's requirements to monitor relevant parameters accurately.\n\n### Deviation 2: Sample Size Margin Adjustment\n\n**Description:** \nWe have applied a 10% margin over the determined sample size to address potential low response rates and answer biases during surveys.\n\n**Justification:** \nAnticipating a possible low response rate and answer bias, this deviation ensures that the sample remains representative and sufficient for accurate data analysis. This proactive measure helps mitigate the risk of data insufficiency or skewed results, thereby maintaining the reliability and conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification.\n\n**Evidence:** \n- The 10% margin ensures that the sample size remains adequate even if the response rate is lower than expected, thus preserving the integrity of the data.\n- This deviation conforms to best practices in survey design and sampling, ensuring that the data collected is both accurate and representative.\n- The representative sampling, as required by the applied methodology, will be adhered to, ensuring that all relevant parameters are monitored effectively.\n\n### Relation to Monitoring or Measurement Criteria\n\nBoth deviations described above are strictly related to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement. They do not impact any other part of the methodology. These deviations are designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of data collection without compromising the overall methodological framework.\n\n**Confirmation:** \n- The deviations are specifically tailored to address sampling and survey procedures, ensuring that the data collected is both accurate and representative.\n- No other aspects of the methodology are affected by these deviations, ensuring that the overall integrity and conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification remain intact.\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology deviations applied are justified and supported by evidence demonstrating that they do not negatively impact the conservativeness of the GHG emission reductions or removals quantification. They are confined to the monitoring or measurement criteria, ensuring that the overall methodological integrity is preserved."

The methodology is based on VMR0006 Version 1.1, which provides detailed equations and parameters for these calculations. Each equation is explained with the necessary data and parameters, allowing for reproducibility of the calculations. The results are presented in tables by vintage period, distinguishing between reductions and removals where applicable.\n\n## Quantification Procedure\n\n### Step 1: Determination of Quantity of Woody Biomass Saved (By,savings,i,j)\nThe quantity of woody biomass saved by improved cookstoves is calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[\nBy,savings,i,j = By=1,new,i,survey \\times \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{new,i,j}}{\\eta_{old}} -

1\\right) = 4.7034 \\text{ tonnes for year } y=2.\n\\]\n\n### Calculation of Emission Reductions (ERy,i,j):\nGiven:\n- \\(By,savings,i,j = 4.7034\\) tonnes\n- \\(NCV_{woodfuel} = 0.0156\\) TJ/tonne\n- \\(fNRB,y = 0.6882\\)\n- \\(EF_{wf,CO2} = 112\\) tCO2/TJ\n- \\(EF_{wf,non CO2} = 26.23\\) tCO2/TJ\n- \\(N_{y,i,j} = 600,000\\)\n\n\\[\nERy,i,j = 4.7034 \\times 0.0156 \\times 0.6882 \\times 138.23 \\times 600,000 \\times 0.95 = 3,978,615 \\text{ tCO2e per annum.}\n\\]\n\n## Data and Parameters Monitored\nThe following estimated data/parameter values are used for calculations:\n\n- **Population size (N):** 600,000 households/ICS.\n- **Expected proportion (p) for \\(N_{y,i,j}\\):** 0.9.\n- **Sample size (n):** 43.\n- **Efficiency of the stove:** Varies, with a 95/10 level of confidence and precision applied for the monitoring period.\n- **Mean expected thermal efficiency of ICS in the first year:** Specific values not provided.\n\n### Sample Size Calculation:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1.962 \\times N \\times p \\times (1 -
