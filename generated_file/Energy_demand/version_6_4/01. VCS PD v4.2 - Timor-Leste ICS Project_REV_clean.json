        "generation": "### Summary Description of the Timor-Leste ICS Project\n\n#### 1. Technologies/Measures to be Implemented\nThe Timor-Leste Improved Cookstove (ICS) Project is designed to enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by distributing and implementing energy-efficient cookstoves across all districts of Timor-Leste. The project will replace traditional three-stone stoves with jumbo stove-type ICS, which boast a thermal efficiency of 38%. These improved cookstoves significantly reduce firewood consumption and harmful emissions. The initiative also includes community training on stove maintenance and proper usage, continuous monitoring through surveys, and the potential future introduction of advanced technologies.\n\n#### 2. Location of the Project\nThis project spans the entire nation of Timor-Leste, encompassing all its districts. Key municipalities involved in the project include Dili, Manatuto, Aileu, Ermera, Likisa, Ainaro, Laut\u00e9m, Viqueque, Baucau, Ambeno, Atauro, Manufahi, Bobonaro, and Covalima.\n\n#### 3. Generation of GHG Emission Reductions or Carbon Dioxide Removals\nThe project aims to generate significant GHG emission reductions by replacing 200,000 traditional three-stone cookstoves with improved cookstoves (ICS). These ICS units require less firewood, thereby decreasing the consumption of non-renewable woody biomass and reducing CO2 emissions. Additionally, the project will help curb deforestation and enhance local ecosystems. Emission reductions will be calculated using the VMR0006 methodology, focusing on the mass of non-renewable woody biomass saved. The project is projected to reduce approximately 507,463 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) annually, totaling about 5,074,630 tCO2e over a ten-year crediting period.\n\n#### 4. Scenario Existing Prior to the Implementation of the Project\nPrior to the implementation of this project, the majority of households in Timor-Leste, particularly in rural areas, relied on traditional three-stone stoves for cooking. These stoves were highly inefficient, consuming large amounts of firewood (approximately 3.45 tonnes per stove per year) and causing chronic health issues due to smoke inhalation. Previous pilot programs aimed at introducing improved cookstoves were unsuccessful in scaling up due to high upfront costs, lack of resources, poor technology selection, and insufficient community involvement.\n\n#### 5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals\nThe project is estimated to achieve an annual average reduction and removal of 507,463 tCO2e. Over a ten-year period, the total reduction and removal is projected to be 5,074,630 tCO2e.\n\nThis comprehensive approach to implementing energy-efficient cookstoves in Timor-Leste not only addresses environmental concerns but also promotes health benefits and sustainable development within the community."

        "generation": "### Description of the Project Activity\n\n#### Project Activities and Technologies Employed\n\nThe project aims to distribute and implement improved cooking stoves (ICS) across all districts of Timor-Leste. The primary technology employed is the Jumbo stove-type ICS, which boasts a thermal efficiency of 38%. This efficiency is a significant improvement over traditional three-stone stoves, which are commonly used in the region. By increasing heat transfer efficiency, the project significantly reduces unsustainable fuelwood consumption, thereby achieving greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.\n\nIn addition to reducing CO2 emissions, the project offers several ancillary benefits. These include preventing deforestation, improving local ecosystems, enhancing indoor air quality, and increasing family welfare by reducing the time and effort required for fuelwood collection.\n\n#### Implementation Schedule\n\nThe project is planned to span over ten years, with a detailed distribution schedule as follows:\n\n- **Year 1**: 30,000 ICS\n- **Year 2**: 50,000 ICS\n- **Year 3**: 60,000 ICS\n- **Year 4**: 60,000 ICS\n- **Year 5**: 200,000 ICS\n- **Year 6**: 200,000 ICS\n- **Year 7**: 200,000 ICS\n- **Year 8**: 170,000 ICS\n- **Year 9**: 120,000 ICS\n- **Year 10**: 60,000 ICS\n\n#### Main Manufacturing/Production Technologies, Systems, and Equipment\n\nThe main technology utilized in this project is the Improved Cookstove (ICS), specifically the Jumbo Stove. The ICS is constructed from durable materials such as steel and aluminium, ensuring longevity and robustness. Below are the key specifications and details:\n\n- **Thermal Efficiency**: 38% (as per ISO 19867 standard water boiling test)\n- **Lifespan**: Expected to last between six to seven years\n- **Loading Capacity**: 40 kg, suitable for various solid fuels including wood, cow-dung, and agro-waste\n- **Selection Criteria for New ICS**: Minimum thermal efficiency of 35% and an expected lifetime of five years\n\nThese stoves are designed to replace the traditional three-stone stoves, which are inefficient and contribute significantly to deforestation and indoor air pollution.\n\n#### Types and Levels of Services Provided\n\nThe ICS units are designed to meet the same thermal energy needs as the traditional three-stone stoves, which are primarily used for cooking and boiling water. The improved efficiency of the ICS means that less fuel is required to achieve the same levels of thermal energy, thus reducing the overall fuelwood consumption and associated emissions.\n\nThe improved cookstoves are directly related to other manufacturing/production equipment and systems outside the project boundary by reducing the demand for non-renewable biomass fuels, thereby decreasing the pressure on local forests and ecosystems.\n\n#### Baseline Scenario\n\nIn the baseline scenario, the same thermal energy needs are met using non-renewable wood fuel and traditional three-stone stoves. These stoves are highly inefficient, leading to excessive fuel consumption and higher GHG emissions. The traditional method of cooking also contributes to deforestation and poor indoor air quality, adversely affecting the health and welfare of families.\n\n#### Existing Scenario Prior to Project Implementation\n\nBefore the implementation of the project, the prevalent cooking method involved the use of firewood on traditional three-stone cookstoves. These stoves are rudimentary and inefficient, leading to high fuel consumption and significant emissions. The reliance on non-renewable biomass fuels has also contributed to deforestation and environmental degradation in the region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis project aims to replace traditional three-stone stoves with improved cooking stoves (ICS) in Timor-Leste, thereby achieving significant GHG emission reductions and providing numerous additional benefits. Through a well-planned implementation schedule and the use of efficient technologies, the project will not only meet the thermal energy needs of the population but also contribute to environmental sustainability and improved public health."

This practice has been entrenched since at least 31 December 1989. The reliance on biomass, particularly firewood, was widespread, as evidenced by the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey of Timor-Leste. The survey highlighted that 86.4 percent of households nationwide depended on firewood for cooking, with a staggering 95 percent of these households situated in rural areas.\n\nIn these rural communities, traditional three-stone cookstoves were the primary technology used for cooking. This method is not only inefficient but also contributes significantly to indoor air pollution and deforestation. The absence of the project would have meant the continued use of these traditional stoves, perpetuating the associated environmental and health issues.\n\n### Project Implementation and GHG Emissions\n\nIt is crucial to underscore that the project was not initiated with the intention of generating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction. The project's primary aim is to address and mitigate the adverse effects associated with the use of non-renewable biomass and traditional cooking methods.\n\n### Baseline Scenario\n\nThe baseline scenario, which mirrors the conditions existing prior to the project initiation, involves the continued use of firewood for cooking on traditional three-stone stoves. This scenario assumes that, in the absence of the project, households would persist in their current practices, using the same quantity of fuelwood for cooking meals and boiling water. \n\nFor further details on the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\nBy providing this comprehensive overview of the conditions prior to project initiation, it is evident that the project was not designed to manipulate GHG emissions. Instead, it aims to foster sustainable practices and improve the quality of life in the region."

        "section_name": "Baseline Emissions",
        "generation": "## Baseline Emissions\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Baseline Emissions\n\nThe quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes involves several key steps and methodological choices, all aimed at ensuring accuracy and reproducibility. Below, we outline the procedures, equations, and justifications used in this process.\n\n#### 1. Determination of Firewood Consumption (Bold)\n\nFirewood consumption is a critical parameter in estimating baseline emissions. For this project, the baseline firewood consumption (Bold) was determined using a baseline survey, which established Bold at 3.45 tonnes per stove annually. Alternatively, historical data or a default value of 0.5 ton/capita/year can be used if specific survey data is unavailable.\n\n#### 2. Efficiency of Cookstoves\n\nThe efficiency of both baseline and improved cookstoves significantly impacts the calculation of emissions reductions.\n\n- **Baseline Cookstove Efficiency (\u03b7old)**: Based on a water boiling test (WBT) survey, the efficiency of the baseline cookstove was determined to be 11.27%.\n- **Improved Cookstove Efficiency (\u03b7new,i,j)**: The efficiency of the improved cookstove is determined through similar testing methods.\n\n#### 3. Calculation of Woody Biomass Saved (By,savings,i,j)\n\nThe amount of woody biomass saved by using improved cookstoves is calculated using Equation 3 of VMR0006:\n\n\\[\nBy,savings,i,j = Bold \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{\u03b7old}{\u03b7new,i,j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( By,savings,i,j \\) = Woody biomass saved by improved cookstove type i and batch j.\n- \\( Bold \\) = Baseline firewood consumption.\n- \\( \u03b7old \\) = Efficiency of the baseline cookstove.\n- \\( \u03b7new,i,j \\) = Efficiency of the improved cookstove type i and batch j.\n\n#### 4. Fraction of Non-Renewable Biomass (fNRB)\n\nThe fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) is calculated using CDM Tool 30. For this project, fNRB is determined to be 76%.\n\n### Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\n\n#### 1. Estimation of Woody Biomass Saved\n\nThe estimation of woody biomass saved is done using the same Equation 3 of VMR0006 as mentioned above.\n\n#### 2. Calculation of Emission Reductions\n\nEmission reductions are calculated using the saved biomass, fNRB, net calorific value of wood fuel (NCVwood fuel), and emission factors for CO2 and non-CO2 gases. A net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to account for uncertainties.

These surveys gather data on the usage and condition of the improved cookstoves (ICS), the use of baseline stoves, and other relevant parameters. The data collection can be done manually or electronically and is compiled in a database for analysis. A sampling standard is used to determine the sample size to achieve 90/10 confidence precision, although a simplified approach may also be used. The project uses a default discount factor to account for efficiency loss of the project cookstove per year of operation. Additionally, the project applies IPCC default values for wood fuel and uses results from a water boiling test (WBT) survey for ex-ante calculations. The minimum sample size for the project's parameters is determined based on the target population size, following guidelines from VMR0006 and UNFCCC CDM Guidelines.\n\n### Purpose of Data\n\nThe primary purpose of the data is to facilitate the calculation of baseline emissions. This ensures that the project can accurately quantify the emissions reductions achieved through the implementation of improved cookstoves.\n\n### Comments\n\n- Appreciation for the project and its benefits such as reduced firewood usage, less smoke, and faster cooking.\n- Suggestions for better consultation and dissemination of information at the village level.\n- Concerns about the sustainability of the project and the inclusion of local industries.\n- Participants suggested extending the distribution of improved cookstoves to schools and rural areas.\n- No comments were received during the public comment period from 25/05/2023 to 24/06/2023.\n\nThis detailed documentation ensures transparency and accuracy in the data and parameters used for the project, supporting its credibility and effectiveness in reducing emissions."
