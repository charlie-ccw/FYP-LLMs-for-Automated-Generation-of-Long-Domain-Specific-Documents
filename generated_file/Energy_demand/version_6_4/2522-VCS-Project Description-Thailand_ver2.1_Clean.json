        "generation": "## Baseline Emissions\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Baseline Emissions and Carbon Stock Changes\n\nThe quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes is a critical component in assessing the impact of implementing improved cookstove projects. This section outlines the procedures and methodologies used to calculate baseline emissions and changes in carbon stocks, ensuring that the process is transparent and reproducible.\n\n### Quantification of Baseline Emissions\n\nBaseline emissions refer to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have occurred in the absence of the project. To quantify these emissions, we apply specific equations that take into account various factors such as the efficiency of the traditional cookstoves, the amount of woody biomass used, and the emission factors for CO2 and non-CO2 gases.\n\n#### Relevant Equations\n\n1. **Net GHG Emission Reductions**:\n   \\[\n   ER_{y,i,j} = B_{y,savings,i,j} \\times NCV_{wood \\, fuel} \\times fNRB_{y} \\times (EF_{wf,CO2} + EF_{wf,non \\, CO2}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95\n   \\]\n   - \\(ER_{y,i,j}\\): Emission reductions for year \\(y\\), cookstove type \\(i\\), and batch \\(j\\).\n   - \\(B_{y,savings,i,j}\\): Quantity of woody biomass saved.\n   - \\(NCV_{wood \\, fuel}\\): Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass.\n   - \\(fNRB_{y}\\): Fraction of woody biomass that is non-renewable.\n   - \\(EF_{wf,CO2}\\): CO2 emission factor for wood fuel.\n   - \\(EF_{wf,non \\, CO2}\\): Non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel.\n   - \\(N_{y,i,j}\\): Number of improved cookstoves in use.\n   - The factor 0.95 accounts for leakage.\n\n2. **Quantity of Woody Biomass Saved**:\n   \\[\n   B_{y,savings,i,j} = B_{y=1,new,i,survey} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\eta_{new,y,i,j}}{\\eta_{old}} - 1 \\right)\n   \\]\n   - \\(B_{y=1,new,i,survey}\\): Quantity of woody biomass saved in the first year.\n   - \\(\\eta_{new,y,i,j}\\): Efficiency of the improved cookstove.\n   - \\(\\eta_{old}\\): Efficiency of the traditional cookstove.\n\n3. **Efficiency of Improved Cookstove**:\n   \\[\n   \\eta_{new,y,i,j} = \\eta_{p} \\times (DF_{n})^{y-1} \\times 0.94\n   \\]\n   - \\(\\eta_{p}\\): Initial efficiency of the improved cookstove.\n   - \\(DF_{n}\\): Degradation factor for the cookstove efficiency over time.\n\n### Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\n\nCarbon stock changes refer to the variations in the amount of carbon stored in biomass due to the project activities. These changes can result in either carbon sequestration (sinks) or emissions. The procedure includes monitoring the biomass usage and applying specific equations to estimate the net changes.\n\n### Handling of Baseline Emissions and Carbon Stock Increases\n\nIn scenarios where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions, the baseline emissions may be considered negative. This indicates a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The methodology requires separate quantification of reductions and removals to ensure clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nThe methodological choices made in this process include:\n\n- **Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values**:\n  - IPCC default values are utilized for various parameters.\n  - A default efficiency value of 0.1 is applied for traditional three-stone fires or conventional devices without improved combustion air supply or flue gas ventilation.\n  - Leakage is accounted for with a default value of 0.95.\n  - The net calorific value of non-renewable woody biomass is set at 0.0156 TJ/tonne.\n  - The CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in the baseline scenario is 112 tCO2/TJ.\n  - The non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel in the baseline scenario is 26.23 tCO2/TJ.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nAll calculations for emission reductions and removals are documented in an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This spreadsheet includes detailed data inputs, intermediate calculations, and final results, allowing for full transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following the outlined procedures and using the specified equations, we ensure accurate and transparent quantification of baseline emissions and carbon stock changes. This methodology provides a robust framework for assessing the environmental benefits of improved cookstove projects, contributing to the overall goal of reducing GHG emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration."

However, the equations used inherently account for these aspects by incorporating factors such as the efficiency of new and old devices, the fraction of non-renewable biomass, and emission factors.\n\n### Relevant Equations\n\nTo accurately quantify leakage emissions, the following equations are applied:\n\n#### Equation (1)\n\n\\[\nER_{y,i,j} = B_{y,\\text{savings},i,j} \\times \\text{NCV}_{\\text{wood fuel}} \\times f_{\\text{NRB},y} \\times (\\text{EF}_{\\text{wf,CO2}} + \\text{EF}_{\\text{wf,non CO2}}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ER_{y,i,j} \\) = Emission reductions in year \\( y \\) for cookstove type \\( i \\) and batch \\( j \\).\n- \\( B_{y,\\text{savings},i,j} \\) = Quantity of woody biomass saved.\n- \\( \\text{NCV}_{\\text{wood fuel}} \\) = Net calorific value of wood fuel.\n- \\( f_{\\text{NRB},y} \\) = Fraction of non-renewable biomass.\n- \\( \\text{EF}_{\\text{wf,CO2}} \\) = CO2 emission factor for wood fuel.\n- \\( \\text{EF}_{\\text{wf,non CO2}} \\) = Non-CO2 emission factor for wood fuel.\n- \\( N_{y,i,j} \\) = Number of cookstoves in operation.\n- \\( 0.95 \\) = Default net to gross adjustment factor for leakages.\n\n#### Equation (2)\n\n\\[\nB_{y,\\text{savings},i,j} = \\text{Quantity of woody biomass that is saved in tonnes per improved cookstove of type } i \\text{ and batch } j \\text{ during year } y\n\\]\n\n#### Equation (3)\n\n\\[\nB_{y,\\text{savings},i,j} = B_{y=1,\\text{new},i,\\text{survey}} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{\\text{new},y,i,j}}{\\eta_{\\text{old}}} - 1\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( B_{y=1,\\text{new},i,\\text{survey}} \\) = Initial biomass savings from surveys.\n- \\( \\eta_{\\text{new},y,i,j} \\) = Efficiency of the new cookstove.\n- \\( \\eta_{\\text{old}} \\) = Efficiency of the baseline cookstove.\n\n#### Equation (4)\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{new},y,i,j} = \\eta_p \\times (\\text{DF}_n)^{y-1} \\times 0.94\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\eta_p \\) = Initial efficiency of the new cookstove.\n- \\( \\text{DF}_n \\) = Degradation factor of the new cookstove.\n\n### Methodological Choices and Justifications\n\n#### Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values\n\nThe methodology employs IPCC default values for parameters such as the CO2 emission factor, non-CO2 emission factor, and net calorific value of wood fuel. These default values are selected for their broad acceptance and consistency in emission quantification processes.\n\n#### Data and Measurement Methods\n\n- **Baseline Devices**: The use of a default value for baseline devices is justified to ensure consistency across different project scenarios.\n- **Fraction of Non-Renewable Biomass (fNRB)**: The determination of fNRB is based on specific survey methods, ensuring that the data reflects the actual biomass consumption and availability.\n\n### Reproducing Calculations\n\nTo allow for the reproduction of calculations, the following information is essential:\n\n1. **Extent of Non-Accessible Forest and Other Wooded Land Areas**: Including protected and geographically remote areas.\n2. **Total Woody Biomass Consumption**: Data on total biomass used.\n3. **Renewable Biomass**: Amount of biomass that is sustainably harvested.\n4. **Non-Renewable Biomass**: Amount of biomass that is not sustainably harvested.\n5. **Fraction of Non-Renewable Biomass (fNRB)**: Calculated using specific survey methods.\n6. **Source Data and Equations from the CDM Methodological Tool 30, Version 03.0**: Ensuring alignment with established methodologies.\n7. **Efficiency of Improved and Baseline Cookstoves**: Data on the efficiency of both new and old cookstoves.\n8. **Net Calorific Value of Non-Renewable Woody Biomass (NCVwood)**: Energy content of the biomass.\n9. **CO2 Emission Factor for Wood Fuel (EFwf,CO2)**: Standard emission factor for CO2.\n10. **Monitoring Survey Methods and Frequency**: Details on how and when data is collected.\n11. **Leakage Default Value of 0.95**: Adjustment factor to account for leakage.\n\nBy adhering to these procedures and justifications, the quantification of leakage emissions can be accurately reproduced and verified, ensuring the reliability of the emission reduction and removal calculations."

cooks is generally easy, but changing the way they collect and prepare fuel can be challenging. Targeting populations that already spend time or energy on fuel preparation or those experiencing a lack of access to cheap firewood is suggested. The organization is conducting a pilot distribution to understand the acceptability of the ICS model and is open to other models based on user feedback.\n2. **Keeping a relationship with target communities**: User satisfaction is higher where there is an ongoing relationship with target communities. This is achieved by partnering with projects like World Vision's nutrition project and appointing Village Stove Pioneers to provide guidance and support. For parameters requiring precision, if reliability checks do not achieve the required precision, the lower or upper bound of estimates can be used. Outliers, defined as data points greater than three standard deviations from the mean, will be examined for errors and omitted from analysis if no errors are found.\n\nThis summary captures the essential details of the data and parameters monitored during the project crediting period."
