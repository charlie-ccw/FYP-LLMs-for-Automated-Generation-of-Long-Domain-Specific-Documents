        "generation": "### Summary Description of the Project\n\n#### 1. Technologies/Measures to be Implemented:\nThe project aims to implement a range of technologies and measures to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Central to this initiative is the distribution of Improved Cookstoves (ICS), such as the Tsinjoharena models, which are designed to reduce smoke, improve fuel efficiency, and decrease particulate matter and carbon emissions. These cookstoves will replace the conventional firewood stoves currently in use. Additionally, the project will establish a comprehensive monitoring and record-keeping system, including an electronic database to track distribution records and ensure data quality and consistency. To verify the performance and usage of the ICS, spot checks and sample surveys will be conducted. Technical staff will receive training for the installation, maintenance, and monitoring of the stoves. Importantly, the project will ensure that no briquettes or processed wood are utilized.\n\n#### 2. Location of the Project:\nThe project is situated in various districts within the Analamanga region of the Republic of Madagascar. These districts include ANTANANARIVO RENIVOHITRA, AMBOHIDRATRIMO, MANJAKANDRIANA, ANJOZOROBE, ANDRAMASINA, ANTANANARIVO ATSIMONDRANO, and ANKAZOBE.\n\n#### 3. GHG Emission Reductions or Carbon Dioxide Removals:\nThe project is expected to generate significant GHG emission reductions by replacing conventional firewood stoves with higher efficiency Improved Cookstoves (ICS). This transition will reduce the use of non-renewable biomass for combustion, decrease heat loss, improve heat transfer, and enhance combustion efficiency. By doing so, the project aims to mitigate deforestation and alleviate the environmental and social burdens caused by inefficient biomass cooking in rural areas.\n\nIn terms of carbon dioxide removals, the introduction of energy-efficient wood stoves (ICS) will replace traditional biomass cookstoves and open fire cooking systems, leading to reduced fuelwood usage in the project area. This shift will result in substantial emission reductions.\n\n#### 4. Scenario Prior to Implementation:\nBefore the project's implementation, rural households in Madagascar predominantly used non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) for cooking. These households relied on traditional biomass cookstoves and open fire cooking systems, which were highly inefficient and contributed to significant environmental and social challenges. The conventional cooking methods, such as 'toko,' were characterized by low thermal efficiency and prolonged cooking times. Notably, over 92% of the energy requirements of the Malagasy community were met by firewood and charcoal.\n\n#### 5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals:\n- **Annual Average GHG Emission Reduction:** The project is estimated to achieve an annual average GHG emission reduction of 313,237 tCO2e.\n- **Total GHG Emission Reductions or Removals:** Over the entire crediting period, the project is projected to achieve total GHG emission reductions or removals amounting to 3,132,379 tCO2e.\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the project's nature and implementation, highlighting the technologies employed, the project's location, the anticipated environmental benefits, the pre-project scenario, and the estimated impact on GHG emissions."

        "section_name": "Baseline Scenario",
        "generation": "## Baseline Scenario\n\n### Introduction\nThe baseline scenario establishes the conditions that would prevail in the absence of the project activity, specifically focusing on the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) by the target population to meet their thermal energy needs. This section identifies and justifies the baseline scenario in accordance with the applied methodology and relevant tools, detailing each procedural step and the outcomes, along with the key assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices.\n\n### Procedure for Baseline Scenario Identification\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)\nThe primary sampling units are determined based on the distribution of Improved Cookstoves (ICS) batches with the same models. This grouping ensures accurate data collection and monitoring of fuel consumption.\n\n#### Step 2: Monitor Fuel Consumption\nThe fuel consumption in the project activity is meticulously tracked to ensure that the thermal energy needs are being met without the use of non-renewable wood fuel. This involves regular monitoring and recording of the fuel used by the distributed ICS.\n\n#### Step 3: Avoidance of Briquettes/Processed Wood\nIt is critical to ensure that no briquettes or processed wood are used in the project case to maintain the integrity of the baseline scenario, which assumes the use of non-renewable wood fuel.\n\n#### Step 4: Distribution Method\nThe distribution method of the project devices is clearly explained to avoid double counting of emissions. Each project device is uniquely identified, and user details are meticulously recorded to track distribution accurately.\n\n#### Step 5: Record-Keeping System\nA robust record-keeping system is implemented, assigning unique identification to each project device and maintaining detailed user information. This system ensures transparency and traceability of the distributed ICS.\n\n#### Step 6: Adjustment for Continued Use of Pre-Project Devices\nTo account for the continued use of pre-project devices, random sub-sample surveys are conducted. These surveys determine the extent of old cookstove usage and help in adjusting the baseline scenario accordingly.\n\n#### Step 7: Calculate Beneficiaries and Emission Reductions\nThe number of beneficiaries and the resulting emission reductions are calculated using monitored parameters. This calculation is essential for understanding the impact of the project activity.\n\n#### Step 8: Surveys for Fuel Collection Time Reduction\nSurveys are conducted to determine the reduction in fuel collection time due to the project activity. This data helps in quantifying the benefits of the project.\n\n#### Step 9: Estimate Sample Sizes\nSample sizes are estimated using previous studies, pilot samples, or best guesses to ensure that the data collected is representative and reliable.\n\n#### Step 10: Sampling Plan\nGiven the large number of ICS units, a representative sampling plan is applied as per the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project requirements. This plan ensures that the sample is statistically significant.\n\n#### Step 11: Demonstrate Additionality\nAdditionality is demonstrated using the Activity Method, which includes regulatory surplus and positive list steps. This ensures that the project activity is not a business-as-usual scenario and provides real and measurable emission reductions.\n\n#### Step 12: Parameter Measurement\nParameters are measured directly or based on representative samples, achieving a 90/10 confidence precision. This high level of precision ensures the reliability of the data collected.\n\n### Key Assumptions and Rationale\n\n#### Continued Use of Firewood\nThe baseline scenario assumes that the target population would continue using non-renewable wood fuel for their thermal energy needs in the absence of the project. This assumption is based on current practices and the lack of alternative energy sources.\n\n#### Energy Equivalence\nThe energy needs of the target population are assumed to be met by a relatively smaller amount of biomass in the project scenario compared to the baseline scenario. This is due to the higher efficiency of the improved cookstoves.\n\n#### Thermal Energy Generation\nIt is assumed that in the absence of the project, thermal energy would continue to be generated using firewood, as this is the prevalent practice among the target population.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\n1. **Continued Use of Firewood**: The baseline scenario is defined by the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel.\n2. **Local Studies for fNRB Value**: Conducting local studies to determine sub-national values ensures accuracy in the baseline scenario.\n3. **Conservative Sample Size Calculation**: A 95/10 confidence/precision level is used for the first monitoring period to ensure data reliability.\n4. **Simple Random Sampling**: This method is applied for monitored parameters to ensure representativeness.\n5. **Leakage Adjustment Factor**: A factor of 0.95 is applied to account for potential leakage.\n6. **Parameter Value Estimation**: Previous studies, preliminary samples, or best guesses are used for parameter value estimation.\n\n### Relevant References\n- **Baseline Scenario**: The continued use of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population.\n- **Current Practices**: The prevalent use of firewood for cooking in the absence of the project.\n- **Baseline Survey Report**: \"On cooking practices and wood for energy consumption in Madagascar\" by CEDII (Nov 2021).\n- **CDM Guidelines**: Guidelines for Sampling and Surveys for CDM Project Activities and Programmes of Activities, version 07.0 Appendix 1 paragraph 5.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis comprehensive identification and justification of the baseline scenario ensure that the project activity's impact is accurately measured and verified. The methodological choices and key assumptions are based on current practices and reliable data, ensuring the robustness of the baseline scenario."

These facts and assumptions justify the credibility of the barriers.\n\n**Performance Method**:\n- No specific information was provided regarding performance methods applied to demonstrate additionality.\n\n**Activity Method Statement**:\n- Conformance with the positive list is demonstrated in the Applicability of Methodology section above.\n\n#### 3. Reproducibility of Additionality Analysis\n\n**Sampling Guidelines**:\n- All households can be sampled in a single survey with a random sample using the confidence/precision levels of 95/10 for biennial monitoring or 90/10 for annual monitoring. The sample size is calculated using the following formula:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{(N - 1) \\times (0.1)^2 \\times p(1 - p)}{1.96^2 \\times p(1 - p)}\n  \\]\n  where \\( N \\) is the population size, \\( p \\) is the expected proportion, and 1.96 represents the 95% confidence level.\n\n**Data/Parameter Values**:\n- **Bold,i,j**: Annual quantity of woody biomass (tonne/year) that would have been used in the absence of the project. Value applied: 4.47192\n- **Bold,p**: Annual quantity of woody biomass per person (tonne/person/year). Value applied: 0.99\n- **Np,HH**: Average number of persons per household. Value applied: 4.5\n- **Ny,i,j**: Number of project devices of type i and batch j operating during year y. Sample size calculation for a 95/10 confidence/precision results in a sample size of 43.\n\n**Monitoring Plan**:\n- Designed to monitor parameters required for the calculation of actual GHG emission reduction using ex post sampling surveys. The project participant will be responsible for conducting the sampling surveys and maintaining a database with all operating stoves.\n\n**Additionality**:\n- The project is not mandated by any government programme or policy and is a voluntary coordinated action. There is no revenue stream apart from the sale of GHG credits, confirming the project\u2019s additionality.\n\n**Efficiency and Lifespan of Cookstoves**:\n- Efficiency values are calculated annually using equation 5 of VMR0006, v1.1, with an initial value of 0.34 and reducing each year. The lifespan of the project device is 5.5 years as per manufacturer specification.\n\n**Population Size and Proportion**:\n- The population size, \\( N \\), is 100,000 households/ICS. The expected proportion, \\( p \\), for Ny,i,j is 0.9.\n\nThis information is sourced from the Cookstove PDD_PARS_V03.1CL document."

        "generation": "## Methodology Deviations\n\n### Current Deviations\nThe project has not applied any methodology deviations. Throughout its implementation, the project activity has strictly adhered to the approved methodology VMR0006, version 1.1.\n\n### Previous Deviations\nSimilarly, no deviations from the approved methodology have been applied in the past. The project has consistently followed the prescribed criteria and procedures.\n\n### Justification and Evidence\n\n#### Conservativeness of GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nTo ensure the conservativeness of the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals, the project has implemented several measures:\n\n1. **Emission Reduction Benefits**:\n   - The project claims emission reduction benefits only for the tested lifetime of the Improved Cookstoves (ICS), which is 5.5 years, even though the crediting period spans 10 years. This approach ensures that the emission reductions are conservatively quantified, based on the actual performance and durability of the stoves.\n\n2. **Leakage Discount Factor**:\n   - A leakage discount factor of 0.95 is applied to account for any potential leakage. This conservative factor ensures that the emission reductions are not overestimated, providing a buffer against any unforeseen emissions that might occur outside the project boundary.\n\n3. **Local Survey**:\n   - A local survey was conducted with a sample size larger than the minimum required. This survey was instrumental in establishing a conservative baseline fuel consumption, ensuring that the emission reductions are based on accurate and reliable data.\n\n#### Scope of Deviation\nThe project has ensured that any deviations relate solely to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement. Specifically:\n\n- **Calculation of Data**:\n  - The project adheres to the approved methodology for calculating data based on monitored parameters. This includes the accurate determination of emission reductions and the reduction in time spent on fuel collection.\n\n- **Monitoring Procedures**:\n  - The project follows the prescribed monitoring procedures to ensure data accuracy and reliability. This adherence guarantees that the emission reductions are quantified based on robust and verifiable data.\n\nIn summary, the project has maintained strict adherence to the approved methodology VMR0006, version 1.1, with no deviations applied, either currently or in the past. The conservative approach taken in the quantification of GHG emission reductions, including the application of a leakage discount factor and the use of a comprehensive local survey, ensures that the emission reductions are both reliable and verifiable. The project's focus on monitoring and measurement criteria further supports the integrity and accuracy of the reported data."

        "generation": "## Project Emissions\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Project Emissions\n\nThe quantification of project emissions and carbon stock changes is essential for evaluating the environmental impact of the project. This section outlines the procedures and methodologies used to quantify these emissions accurately.\n\n#### 1. Historical Data Collection\n\nTo establish a baseline, historical data or baseline surveys are conducted to determine the quantity of firewood consumed in the absence of the project activity. This baseline consumption (\\(B_{\\text{old}}\\)) serves as a reference point for measuring the impact of the project.\n\n#### 2. Monitoring Plan\n\nA comprehensive monitoring plan is designed to track the parameters required for calculating actual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. This involves ex post sampling surveys to collect data on fuel consumption and other relevant variables during the crediting period.\n\n#### 3. Emission Reduction Calculation\n\nThe emission reductions are calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[ ER_{y,I,j} = B_{\\text{savings},i,j} \\times \\text{NCV}_{\\text{wood fuel}} \\times f_{\\text{NRB}y} \\times (EF_{\\text{wf,CO2}} + EF_{\\text{wf,non CO2}}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( ER_{y,I,j} \\) = Emission reduction in year y for scenario i and j\n- \\( B_{\\text{savings},i,j} \\) = Woody biomass saved\n- \\( \\text{NCV}_{\\text{wood fuel}} \\) = Net calorific value of wood fuel\n- \\( f_{\\text{NRB}y} \\) = Fraction of non-renewable biomass in year y\n- \\( EF_{\\text{wf,CO2}} \\) = Emission factor for CO2 from wood fuel\n- \\( EF_{\\text{wf,non CO2}} \\) = Emission factor for non-CO2 gases from wood fuel\n- \\( N_{y,i,j} \\) = Number of improved cook stoves (ICS) in use\n- 0.95 = Discount factor for leakage\n\n#### 4. Fuel Consumption Monitoring\n\nThe consumption of fuel used in the project activity is monitored throughout the crediting period. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the emission reduction calculations.\n\n#### 5. Project Description\n\nThe project description includes details on the distribution of project devices, measures to avoid double counting of emission reductions, and methods to ensure traceability of each improved cook stove (ICS).\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\n\nWhile the document does not provide specific procedures for quantifying carbon stock changes, it is crucial to consider the impact of the project on carbon sequestration. This involves assessing the increase in carbon stock due to reduced deforestation and improved land management practices.\n\n### Quantification when Carbon Stock Increases Exceed Project Emissions\n\nIn cases where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed project emissions, the methodology quantifies net emission reductions without separately accounting for baseline and project emissions. This ensures a comprehensive assessment of the project's impact on the environment.\n\n### Separate Specification of Reductions and Removals\n\n#### Reductions Calculation\n\nThe net GHG emission reductions are calculated using the following equations:\n\n1. **Adjusted Baseline Firewood Consumption**:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{old, adjusted}} = B_{\\text{old}} \\times (1- \\mu_{y}) \\]\n\n2. **Annual Quantity of Woody Biomass**:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{old,HH}} = B_{\\text{old,p}} \\times N_{\\text{p,HH}} \\]\n\n3. **Emission Reductions**:\n\n\\[ ER_{y} = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} ER_{y,I,j} \\]\n\n4. **Woody Biomass Saved**:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{savings,I,j}} = B_{\\text{old}} \\times (1-(\\eta_{\\text{old}} / \\eta_{\\text{new,i,j}})) \\]\n\n5. **Efficiency of Improved Cookstove**:\n\n\\[ \\eta_{\\text{new,i,j}} = \\eta_{\\text{P}} \\times (DF_{\\text{n}})^{y-1} \\times 0.94 \\]\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\n#### Data Justification\n\nThe choice of data, measurement methods, and procedures must be justified. This includes selecting emission factors and default values based on third-party reports and fixed ex-ante values as per the methodological tool.\n\n#### Measurement Methods\n\nMethods and procedures for data collection should be clearly described, including whether direct measurement or sampling is used. Sample size estimates should be calculated using sampling standards to achieve 90/10 confidence precision.\n\n#### Adjustments and Leakages\n\nAdjustments based on pilot studies and previous monitoring periods should be made. Potential leakages must be accounted for, and appropriate adjustment factors should be applied.\n\n#### Survey Design\n\nSurveys should be designed to capture relevant data on cooking habits, stove usage, and other factors influencing fuel consumption and emissions.\n\n### Emission Factors and Default Values\n\nEmission factors and default values should be selected based on third-party reports and methodological tools. For example, a default value of 0.1 may be applied for a three-stone fire using firewood.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nAll calculations should be included in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This ensures transparency and allows for the reproduction of the calculations by the reader.\n\nBy following these procedures and methodologies, the quantification of project emissions and carbon stock changes can be conducted accurately and reliably, providing a comprehensive assessment of the project's environmental impact."

This plan ensures that the monitored data is accurate, reliable, and collected in a manner that supports the project's objectives. The following sections detail the methods, organizational structure, internal auditing procedures, handling of non-conformances, sampling approaches, and, where appropriate, line diagrams for the GHG data collection and management system.\n\n## Methods for Measuring, Recording, Storing, Aggregating, Collating, and Reporting Monitored Data and Parameters\n\n### Measurement and Recording\n\n1. **Efficiency Estimation**: Conducted annually using a predefined equation to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n2. **Operational Lifetime**: Recorded once at installation based on manufacturer specifications to maintain accurate records of device longevity.\n3. **Commissioning Date**: Grouped in batches and recorded at the time of the last device's commissioning to streamline data management.\n4. **Surveys**: Conducted at least every two years to monitor the continued operation of cookstoves, achieving a 95/10 confidence/margin of error.\n5. **Distribution Record**: User information is collected at distribution and transferred to an electronic database for secure and efficient data management.\n\n### Storing and Aggregating\n\nData is stored in a centralized electronic database, ensuring secure and organized data management. Aggregation of data occurs periodically to facilitate analysis and reporting.\n\n### Collating and Reporting\n\nData collating involves compiling the monitored data into comprehensive reports. The Project Manager summarizes the data and reports to the Compliance Manager, who ensures compliance with VCS rules and prepares the final monitoring reports.\n\n### Calibration Procedures\n\nCalibration procedures are not applicable as most parameters are measured through surveys and manufacturer specifications. This approach ensures that the data remains consistent and reliable.\n\n## Organizational Structure, Responsibilities, and Competencies\n\n### Key Personnel and Responsibilities\n\n1. **PARS**: Manages the overall project and oversees the management system.\n2. **Project Manager**: Summarizes data and reports to the Compliance Manager.\n3. **Compliance Manager**: Writes monitoring reports and ensures compliance with VCS rules.\n4. **Technical Review Team**: Conducts technical reviews of processes and documentation.\n5. **Local Partners**: Oversee distribution centers and collaborate with the Project Manager on planning and reporting monitoring data.\n6. **Logistics Manager**: Handles planning, contractor management, and reporting.\n7. **Data Administrators**: Manage the monitoring database and perform data reconciliations.\n8. **Monitoring Team**: Gathers compliance and marketing data.\n9. **Distribution Team**: Ensures quality stove distributions.\n10. **Training and Capacity Development**: Provided for all key personnel, with records maintained to ensure ongoing competency.\n\n## Procedures for Internal Auditing and QA/QC\n\n### Internal Auditing\n\n1. **Random Selection**: Trained field staff randomly select households from the database for visits to ensure unbiased data collection.\n2. **Cross-Check**: Database information is cross-checked with field evidence to verify accuracy.\n3. **Updates**: Inconsistencies, such as address changes, are updated in the database to maintain current records.\n4. **Exclusions**: Non-used improved cookstoves are marked and excluded from emission reductions calculations to ensure accurate reporting.\n5. **Spot Checks**: Performed during the first year of the project's operation to validate initial data collection processes.\n\n### QA/QC Procedures\n\nQA/QC procedures include random sampling using random number generators, maintaining a distribution record, and achieving a 95/10 confidence/margin of error. Oversampling is encouraged to compensate for attrition, outliers, or non-responses, ensuring data integrity.\n\n## Procedures for Handling Non-Conformances\n\nWhile specific procedures for handling non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan are not detailed, it is imperative to establish a robust mechanism to address any deviations promptly. This may include:\n\n1. Identifying the non-conformance.\n2. Investigating the root cause.\n3. Implementing corrective actions.\n4. Documenting the resolution process.\n5. Reviewing and updating the monitoring plan to prevent recurrence.\n\n## Sampling Approaches\n\n### Target Precision Levels\n\n- **Annual Sampling**: 95/10 confidence/precision level.\n- **Biennial Sampling**: 95/5 confidence/precision level.\n\n### Sample Sizes and Site Locations\n\n- **Minimum Sample Size**: 30, typically around 43 for a 95/10 confidence/precision level.\n- **Sample Site Locations**: Primary Sampling Units based on the homogeneity of ICS models.\n- **Stratification**: Grouping ICS models to create homogeneous Primary Sampling Units.\n\n### Frequency of Measurement\n\nMeasurements are conducted at least once every two years to ensure ongoing accuracy and reliability of the data.\n\n### QA/QC Procedures\n\nQA/QC procedures for sampling include random sampling using random number generators, maintaining a distribution record, and achieving the desired confidence/margin of error. Oversampling is encouraged to compensate for potential data issues such as attrition, outliers, or non-responses.\n\n## Line Diagrams\n\nWhile specific line diagrams are not available, it is recommended to develop visual representations of the GHG data collection and management system. These diagrams can provide a clear and concise overview of the data flow, enhancing understanding and transparency.\n\n---\n\nThis Monitoring Plan ensures a comprehensive and systematic approach to data collection, management, and reporting, supporting the project's goals and compliance requirements."
