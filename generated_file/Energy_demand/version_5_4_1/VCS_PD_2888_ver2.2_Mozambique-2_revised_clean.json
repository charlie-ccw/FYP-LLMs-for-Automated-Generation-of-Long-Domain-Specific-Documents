The key GHG sources in the project scenario include CO2, CH4, and N2O, with the primary focus on mitigating emissions from the combustion of biomass for cooking purposes. The justification for including these gases lies in the transition from traditional, inefficient cooking methods to modern, cleaner technologies that promote sustainable energy practices. Other GHGs may also be considered based on the specific characteristics of the project.\n\n**Diagram of Project Boundary:**\nThe diagram below illustrates the project boundary for the implementation of high-efficiency stoves using woody biomass in Mozambique-2.

These metrics are crucial for quantifying estimated reductions and removals in the project crediting period. The measurement methods involve weighing scales calibration, emission testing equipment, usage tracking systems, and thermocouple measurements. Regular monitoring and recording frequencies ensure accurate data collection. Quality assurance and quality control procedures such as calibration checks, data quality checks, and consistency checks are implemented to maintain measurement accuracy. The purpose of the data ranges from calculating baseline emissions to assessing project emissions and leakage. Calculation methods are specified for each parameter to facilitate accurate quantification. Additional quality checks and monitoring reporting enhance the reliability of the data collected."

        "section_name": "Monitoring Plan",
        "generation": "## Monitoring Plan\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive process and schedule for obtaining, recording, compiling, and analyzing the monitored data and parameters specified in Section 5.2 (Data and Parameters Monitored). The monitoring plan encompasses various key aspects to ensure accurate data collection and management in line with organizational objectives.\n\n### Methods for Measuring, Recording, and Storing Data\n\nThe monitoring process involves direct measurement or sampling based on representative samples, ensuring data accuracy and reliability. Monitoring and recording activities are scheduled to be conducted at least once every two years to maintain up-to-date information. Procedures include data collection methods, storage in a monitoring database, development of a sample plan for monitoring surveys, and calibration of monitoring equipment to guarantee precision and consistency.\n\n### Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities\n\nField personnel responsible for carrying out monitoring activities are equipped with the necessary training on monitoring plan procedures, quality control, and assurance strategies. They are also trained in surveying households to prevent bias and are provided with proper guidance before conducting onsite monitoring surveys. This ensures that monitoring tasks are performed competently and in accordance with established protocols.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\n\nInternal auditing and quality assurance procedures are in place to uphold the integrity of the monitoring data. This includes periodic audits, surveillance of distributed equipment, and verification of required confidence levels for each sampled parameter. Spot checks of equipment, sample surveys, and calibration processes are conducted to maintain data accuracy and reliability throughout the monitoring process.\n\n### Handling Non-Conformances with the Validated Monitoring Plan\n\nIn cases of non-conformances with the monitoring plan, measures are implemented to ensure that the required confidence and precision levels for each sampled parameter are met. This may involve addressing non-responses, removing outliers from the sample, and reviewing and reinforcing adherence to monitoring plan procedures by field personnel. By promptly addressing deviations from the plan, data integrity is preserved.\n\n### Sampling Approaches and QA/QC Procedures\n\nSampling approaches are designed to achieve the desired confidence and precision levels, with sample sizes determined to ensure statistical validity. Proper training is provided to monitoring personnel before onsite surveys to enhance data collection accuracy. Sampling strategies include oversampling and buffer group sampling to capture a representative range of data points. QA/QC procedures are integrated into the monitoring process to uphold data quality standards.\n\nFor a visual representation of the GHG data collection and management system, refer to the accompanying line diagrams that illustrate the flow of monitored data from collection to analysis and reporting. These diagrams provide a clear overview of the monitoring framework and data management structure."
