This scenario is crucial for understanding the current energy consumption patterns and serves as a benchmark for assessing the impact of the proposed project.\n\n### Procedure and Outcome\n\nThe methodology for determining the baseline scenario comprises several steps that are systematically applied to derive a comprehensive understanding of the existing situation. The first step involves analyzing the current usage of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population. This is followed by assessing the thermal energy needs that are currently being met by the traditional fuel source. Through this process, the outcome reveals the baseline scenario where the reliance on non-renewable wood fuel persists without any intervention.\n\n### Justification of Key Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices\n\nThe key assumption underpinning the baseline scenario is the classification of the difference between woody biomass consumption and renewable biomass as non-renewable. This assumption is based on the estimated utilization of 1,192,804 tons per year in Bangladesh, highlighting the significant reliance on non-renewable wood fuel in meeting energy demands.\n\nThe rationale behind this assumption is to establish a clear distinction between renewable and non-renewable energy sources, emphasizing the need to transition towards sustainable alternatives. The methodological choices made in defining the baseline scenario aim to provide a robust foundation for evaluating the impact of the project on promoting renewable energy solutions and reducing dependence on non-renewable resources.\n\n### References\n\nTo support the baseline scenario, key assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices, relevant references have been consulted to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the information presented.
