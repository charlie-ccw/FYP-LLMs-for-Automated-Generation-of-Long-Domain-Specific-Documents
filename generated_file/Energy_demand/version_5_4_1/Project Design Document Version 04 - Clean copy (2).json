The following section outlines the detailed procedure for quantifying project emissions and/or carbon stock changes in alignment with the applied methodology.\n\n### Baseline Emissions Determination\nThe baseline emissions are initially determined by assessing the usage of fossil fuels for similar thermal energy needs. This serves as a reference point for evaluating the emissions reduction potential of the project.\n\n### Project Emissions Calculation\nProject emissions within the project boundary primarily involve households utilizing efficient cook stoves in specific districts. These emissions are calculated considering the energy consumption patterns and efficiency improvements brought about by the project activities.\n\n### Negative Emissions Calculation\nIn cases where carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed project emissions, project emissions are quantified as negative emissions or removals. This accounts for the additional carbon sequestration resulting from the project interventions.\n\n### Reductions and Removals Specification\nTo specify reductions and removals separately, the following equation is utilized:\n```\nERy = By,savings X fNRB,y X NCV biomass X EFprojectedfossilfuel\n```\nWhere:\n- ERy represents the emissions reduction/removal in year 'y'\n- By,savings denotes the energy savings due to project activities\n- fNRB,y signifies the fraction of non-renewable biomass in year 'y'\n- NCV biomass represents the net calorific value of biomass\n- EFprojectedfossilfuel indicates the emission factor for projected fossil fuel usage\n\n### Methodological Choices and Justifications\nThe AMS-II.G methodology has been selected for this project, focusing on the dissemination of higher efficiency biomass-fired cook stoves. This choice aligns with the project objectives and ensures a standardized approach to emissions quantification.\n\nIn the selection of emission factors and default values, a default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ is employed for estimating emission reductions. This decision is based on the relevance of the factor to the project context and its alignment with established guidelines.\n\n### Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet\nAll calculations related to emission reductions and removals, including the application of the specified equations and methodology, are documented in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet.
