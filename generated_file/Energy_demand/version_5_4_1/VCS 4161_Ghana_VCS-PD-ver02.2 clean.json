These stoves are designed with a minimum efficiency of 25% to enhance cooking practices, reduce burn injuries, promote local employment opportunities, and provide access to clean cooking technologies.\n\n## 2. Project Location\nThe project will be executed in Ghana, situated at coordinates 7\u00b056'47.5'' N latitude and 1\u00b01.392' W longitude.\n\n## 3. GHG Emission Reductions or Carbon Dioxide Removals\nBy distributing fuel-efficient improved cookstoves like the TLC-CQC Rocket Stove, the project aims to generate a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It is anticipated to result in an annual reduction of 1,126,602 tonnes of CO2. These stoves significantly decrease fuel consumption and emissions related to cooking and water heating tasks, thereby contributing to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## 4. Scenario Prior to Project Implementation\nBefore the implementation of the project, the prevailing scenario involved the utilization of non-renewable wood fuel by the target population. This was predominantly done through inefficient three-stone fires or traditional stoves lacking improved combustion mechanisms, leading to higher emissions and energy inefficiency.\n\n## 5. Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions\nThe project is projected to achieve an annual average reduction of 1,126,602 tonnes of CO2e. Over a span of 10 years, the total reduction is estimated to reach 11,266,021 tonnes of CO2e. This substantial reduction underscores the project's significant impact on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices.\n\n---\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, outlining the technologies/measures implemented, project location, expected GHG emission reductions, the scenario before project initiation, and the estimated annual and total reductions.
