This initiative aims to address multiple objectives, including reducing firewood consumption, mitigating climate change, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving forests, enhancing health conditions, and preventing fire hazards.\n\n**Technologies/Measures Implemented**\n\nThe project focuses on deploying energy-efficient cookstoves to replace the traditional method of using firewood in three stone open fires for cooking purposes. By introducing the Soarehitra improved Cookstove technology, the project aims to significantly reduce the reliance on firewood and promote sustainable cooking practices.\n\n**Location of the Project**\n\nSituated in the Haute Matsiatra region of Madagascar, the project is strategically positioned to target communities that heavily rely on traditional cooking methods using firewood. This region serves as the operational base for implementing the Soarehitra improved Cookstove technology.\n\n**Expected GHG Emission Reductions and Carbon Dioxide Removals**\n\nThrough the adoption of energy-efficient cookstoves, the project anticipates generating substantial GHG emission reductions. The estimated annual average reduction is projected to reach 37,722 tCO2e, with a total reduction of 377,220 tCO2e over the course of 10 crediting years. Additionally, the project aims to enhance Indoor Air Quality, reduce fire hazards, promote ecological balance, and safeguard forest resources.\n\n**Scenario Prior to Implementation**\n\nBefore the inception of the project, the prevailing scenario revolved around the utilization of firewood in inefficient three stone open fires to fulfill cooking energy requirements. This traditional method not only resulted in high firewood consumption but also contributed to environmental degradation and health hazards.\n\n**Estimates of Annual Average and Total Reductions**\n\nThe project forecasts an annual average GHG emission reduction of 37,722 tCO2e, translating to a significant total reduction of 377,220 tCO2e over the project's duration. These reductions signify a substantial contribution towards mitigating climate change, conserving natural resources, and improving the overall well-being of the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of the Soarehitra improved Cookstove technology in the Haute Matsiatra region embodies a holistic approach towards sustainable development, emphasizing environmental protection, health enhancement, and carbon footprint reduction."

These deviations have been carefully considered and justified to ensure that they do not have a detrimental impact on the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals. It is important to note that these deviations pertain solely to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement and do not extend to other aspects of the methodology.\n\n### Justification of Deviations\n\n1. **GHG Emission Quantification Impact:** The project activity has been registered as a CPA under a CDM-PoA. The GHG emission reductions and removals generated by the project will not be utilized for compliance under any programs or mechanisms except CDM. This segregation ensures that the quantification of emission reductions remains accurate and prevents any double accounting of emission reductions. Therefore, the deviation does not compromise the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emissions.\n\n2. **Focus on Monitoring or Measurement:** The deviation specifically focuses on the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement. By applying a default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95, as outlined in the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G, the project accounts for potential leakage. This targeted deviation ensures that monitoring and measurement processes are appropriately adjusted without affecting other aspects of the methodology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology deviations implemented have been carefully justified to align with the requirements outlined in the VCS-PD document. By ensuring that these deviations do not negatively impact the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals and are limited to monitoring or measurement procedures, the project maintains the integrity of its emission quantification process."

All methodological choices, including the rationale behind the selection of specific factors and values, should be clearly explained and justified.\n\n**Calculations and Spreadsheet:**\n\n1. **Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet:** All calculations related to baseline emissions, carbon stock changes, reductions, and removals should be documented in a comprehensive spreadsheet.
