Proper methods for data measurement, reporting, calibration of monitoring equipment, and organizational structure with assigned responsibilities are crucial components of the monitoring process. Internal auditing and quality assurance/control procedures are implemented to maintain data integrity, with trained field staff conducting random checks to verify database information. Sampling approaches, including Simple Random Sampling for monitored parameters Ny,i,j and \u00b5y,i,j, are employed to achieve a 90/10 confidence precision level. Line diagrams are utilized to visually represent the GHG data collection and management system for enhanced transparency and understanding. By following these detailed procedures, the monitoring and analysis of data can be efficiently conducted to ensure accurate and reliable information."
