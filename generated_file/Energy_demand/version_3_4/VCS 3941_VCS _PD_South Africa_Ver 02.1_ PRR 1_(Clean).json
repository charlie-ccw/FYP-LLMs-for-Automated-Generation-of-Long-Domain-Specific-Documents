The comment raised concerns about potential double counting of emission reductions within the project. To address this issue, the company swiftly implemented a unique identification system for each distributed cookstove, ensuring no duplication of emission reductions. This system consists of a customer name, geographical location, and a serial number. The project design has been revised to incorporate this change, aligning with CDM project activities and voluntary carbon schemes.\n\n**Actions Taken**\n\nIn response to the received comment, the company issued a public apology and offered a full refund to the customer for any inconvenience caused. Furthermore, the project design was updated to include the unique identification system, minimizing the risk of double counting emission reductions. This enhancement bolsters the project's transparency and credibility in environmental impact assessment.\n\n**Justification for No Further Updates**\n\nWhile no specific justification was provided for the absence of additional updates to the project design, the implemented unique identification system effectively resolves the concerns raised in the comment, rendering further modifications unnecessary at present.\n\nOverall, the company has exhibited a proactive stance in addressing public comments and upholding the integrity of the project design. The integration of the unique identification system underscores a dedication to transparency and accountability in emission reduction endeavors."
