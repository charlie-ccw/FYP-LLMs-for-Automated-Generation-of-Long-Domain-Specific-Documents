By replacing traditional cookstoves with high thermal efficient ICS, the project aims to enhance thermal energy transfer, reduce fuelwood consumption, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe distribution and installation of ICS will be carried out free of cost for households unable to afford them. Users will be informed about the carbon finance generated through the use of ICS, which will cover the stove's cost and project implementation expenses.\n\n**Project Scope**\n\nInitially focused in the Assam state of India, the project may expand to other regions as detailed in Section 1.12. It will target households currently relying on non-renewable biomass for cooking, offering a sustainable alternative to open-fire cooking.\n\n**Project Timeline and Impact**\n\nThe first phase of the project, involving 1,000 ICS installations, is scheduled to commence on 01-November-2023. The estimated annual GHG emission reduction for this phase is 6,956 tCO2e, with a cumulative reduction of 48,690 tCO2e over the entire project duration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThrough the widespread adoption of ICS, the project aims to combat deforestation, reduce indoor air pollution, and improve the livelihoods of women and children in rural communities. By promoting sustainable cooking practices, the project seeks to achieve significant environmental and health benefits."

The core objective is to reduce the consumption of non-renewable biomass for cooking, thereby mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from biomass combustion and fostering sustainable development. This initiative is anticipated to bring about social, economic, and environmental benefits to households and communities.\n\n**Implementation Schedule:**\n- Phase 1 (PI3 to PI8): 29th April 2023\n- Phase 2 (PI9 to PI15): 30th April 2023\n- Phase 3 (PI16 to PI22): 1st May 2023\n- Phase 4 (PI23 to PI33): 2nd May 2023\n- Phase 5 (PI34 to PI40): 3rd May 2023\n\n**Manufacturing/Production Technologies and Equipment:**\n\nThe project entails the installation of Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) with an average lifespan of 7 years. The primary technologies and equipment employed include the ICS units, which are designed to enhance cooking efficiency and reduce emissions. These systems incorporate features for routine maintenance, software upgrades, and technical assistance to ensure optimal functionality.\n\n**Relation to Other Equipment and Systems:**\n\nThe modified systems are integrated with pre-existing manufacturing equipment and systems beyond the project scope. This new interconnected setup enables seamless data exchange and operational efficiency, thereby improving the overall cooking experience and environmental footprint.\n\n**Baseline Service Provision:**\n\nIn the existing setup, the project aims to swap traditional three-stone cook stoves with improved cook stoves in selected households. The baseline service provision involves distributing improved cook stoves free of charge to households currently utilizing inefficient cooking methods.\n\n**Existing Scenario Facilities and Equipment:**\n\nCurrently, traditional cook stoves are predominantly in use in the targeted regions, leading to higher emissions and lower cooking efficiency compared to the improved cook stoves introduced through the project.\n\nBy deploying energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves and harnessing innovative technologies, this project is set to significantly reduce GHG emissions, boost cooking efficiency, and promote sustainable practices in rural communities across India."

The specific parameter under observation is the share of operating stoves, denoted in tCO2/TJ, sourced from VCS ODISHA V10.0 Clean Mode. The measurement methods involve sampling procedures conducted by the PP, with the monitoring frequency to be determined in the initial project year. The estimated value for operating stoves is 0.0156, with Improved Cookstoves (ICS) serving as the monitoring equipment. Quality assurance and quality control procedures, along with calibration methods, will be implemented to ensure precise measurements. The primary objective of monitoring the operating stoves data is for emission reduction calculations, where the proportion of operational stoves from the survey will be multiplied by the total commissioned stoves. No additional comments are provided for this parameter."
