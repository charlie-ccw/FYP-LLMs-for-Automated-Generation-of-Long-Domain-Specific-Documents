'Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass', Version 11.0. The methodology offers a straightforward approach to address leakage without the necessity of extensive surveys or separate management.\n\n### Methodology Overview\nThe CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. Version 11.0 focuses on enhancing energy efficiency in thermal applications utilizing non-renewable biomass, particularly through the implementation of improved cooking stoves (ICS). These stoves significantly reduce fuelwood consumption, classified as non-renewable biomass with a higher emission factor, thereby magnifying emission reductions.\n\n### Leakage Emissions Adjustment\nAs per paragraph 39 of the methodology, a default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to accommodate leakage emissions. This conservative estimate simplifies the process by inherently adjusting the emission reductions for potential leakage, eliminating the need for additional surveys or separate management.\n\n### Emission Reductions and Removals\nEmission reductions and removals are calculated using the default adjustment factor specified in the methodology. The methodology contains the specific equations for these calculations, referenced in the registered CPA-DD, section B.4.\n\n#### Equation for Emission Reductions\nThe formula for calculating emission reductions (ERy) is:\n\nERy = BEy - PEy - LEy\n\nWhere:\n- ERy = Emission reductions in year y (tCO2e)\n- BEy = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO2e)\n- PEy = Project emissions in year y (tCO2e)\n- LEy = Leakage emissions in year y (tCO2e)\n\nGiven the 0.95 adjustment factor, the equation for leakage emissions (LEy) is:\n\nLEy = (1 - 0.95) * BEy\nLEy = 0.05 * BEy\n\n### Justification for Methodological Choices\nThe selection of the default adjustment factor of 0.95 aligns with the guidelines of CDM Methodology AMS-II.G, providing a conservative estimate that adequately addresses potential leakage without the need for additional data collection.\n\n### Reproduction of Calculations\nReproducing the calculations involves following the steps outlined in CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. Version 11.0 and applying the default adjustment factor as prescribed. Documentation in an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet ensures transparency and traceability.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe quantification of leakage emissions under this methodology is simplified through the use of a default adjustment factor, ensuring conservative accounting for leakage and maintaining the credibility of emission reduction claims.\n\n### References\n- CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. 'Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass', Version 11.0\n- Registered CPA-DD, Section B.4\n\nAdhering to this methodology guarantees precise quantification of leakage emissions, enhancing the effectiveness and credibility of emission reduction endeavors."
