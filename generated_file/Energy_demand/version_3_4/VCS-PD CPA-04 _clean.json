This traditional practice not only proved inefficient but also led to substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, deforestation, and indoor air pollution-related health issues.\n\nThe baseline scenario, mirroring the prevailing practices, aligns with the aforementioned traditional cooking method. For a detailed depiction, please consult Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\n#### GHG Emission Reduction Assurance\n\nThe Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project's primary objective is to deploy energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) in wood-consuming households. The project's overarching aims include decreasing firewood usage, sustainable climate change mitigation, preservation of forests, and enhancement of indoor air quality for ICS users.\n\nIt is imperative to highlight that the project's initiation does not intend to generate GHG emissions for subsequent reduction, elimination, or eradication. This initiative is classified as a Component Project Activity (CPA) within the Clean Development Mechanism Programme of Activities (CDM-PoA), Ref. 10477. The GHG emission reductions and removals attributable to the project will solely be credited under the CDM framework and not for compliance with other programs or mechanisms.\n\nCommencing on 28 June 2019, the project's timeline spans a decade, concluding on 27 June 2029. Korea Carbon Management Ltd., under the leadership of Mr. Thomas Winklehner as the Chief Executive Officer, spearheads this initiative. The project's funding is entirely provided by Carbon Management (KCM).\n\n### Summary\n\nTo summarize, the pre-project conditions entailed the prevalent use of firewood in three-stone open fires for cooking, constituting the baseline scenario. The project aims to supplant this inefficient and polluting practice with energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves, yielding substantial environmental, societal, and economic benefits. The project's primary focus does not involve generating GHG emissions for subsequent reduction, elimination, or eradication, with all GHG emission reductions accounted for within the CDM framework.\n\nFor further insights into the baseline scenario, kindly refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario)."

The project operates voluntarily and is not constrained by mandatory host country compliance schemes. With no specific local or regional regulations related to cook stove projects in Viet Nam, the flexibility for methodological adjustments is ensured.\n\n#### Evidence of Non-Negative Impact on Conservativeness\n1. **Thermal Efficiency Test**: A thermal efficiency test conducted by the GERES Biomass and Energy Laboratory (G-BEL) on the TK90 Improved Cookstove (ICS) revealed a 28.57% thermal efficiency, surpassing traditional stoves. This outcome guarantees that the deviation will not compromise the conservativeness of GHG emission reductions.\n\n2. **Lifespan and Firewood Savings**: The TK90 ICS boasts a minimum 10-year lifespan and offers substantial firewood savings while maintaining energy output comparable to traditional stone fires. This feature ensures sustainable and verifiable emission reductions over an extended period.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Double Accounting**: The project activity under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) will not claim emission reductions for periods covered by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) within the registered Programme of Activities (PoA). This strategy eliminates the risk of double accounting, preserving the integrity and conservativeness of the quantification process.\n\n#### Scope of Deviation\nThe deviations are exclusively related to monitoring or measurement criteria and procedures, leaving the core principles and objectives of the project unchanged and intact.\n\n#### Previous Deviations\nNo previous deviations have been applied to this project.\n\n#### Approval and Contact Information\nThe project activity received the \u2018Letter of Approval\u2019 (LoA) from the Host Country Designated National Authority (DNA) on 07/01/2022. For additional information or clarification, please reach out to:\n\n**Mr. Thomas Winklehner**\nChief Executive Officer\n9F, N\u2019deavor Tower, 45, Seocho-dearo 74-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06626, Republic of Korea\nTelephone: +82 2 3487 6050\nEmail: info@korea-carbon.com\n\n### Conclusion\nThe deviations implemented in the Viet Nam Improved Cookstove Project are well-founded and backed by substantial evidence indicating their non-negative impact on GHG emission reduction conservativeness. These deviations are confined to monitoring and measurement procedures, ensuring the project's integrity remains uncompromised and aligned with the voluntary and regulatory frameworks established by the Designated National Authority of Viet Nam."
