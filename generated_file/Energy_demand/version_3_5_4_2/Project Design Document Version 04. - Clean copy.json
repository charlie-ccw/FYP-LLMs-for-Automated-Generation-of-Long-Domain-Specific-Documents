The methodology utilized integrates a default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ for estimating emission reductions. The calculation of the baseline scenario involves a specific formula:\n\n\\[ ER_y = B_y,savings \\times fNRB,y \\times NCV_{biomass} \\times EF_{projected fossil fuel} \\]\n\nThe process of determining the baseline scenario includes multiplying the baseline fuelwood consumption by a net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 to mitigate potential system leakages.\n\nKey assumptions underpinning this baseline scenario encompass various elements such as anticipated economic growth rates, demographic patterns, technological progress, and policy frameworks. These assumptions are substantiated by the existing conditions, particularly the imbalance between fuelwood demand and supply in the region, notably in Maharashtra. The excessive extraction of fuelwood due to population density has resulted in a situation where demand exceeds natural replenishment capacities.\n\nMethodological decisions are grounded in the AMS - II G. Ver.3 - Energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass. The rationale for these decisions lies in the project's compliance with the eligibility criteria of the chosen methodology, which emphasizes energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass.\n\nFor more detailed information and comprehensive references, please refer to section B 6.1 of the PDD of the UNFCCC registered CDM project under reference no. 8771.\n\nThis document elucidates the reasoning, process, and validation behind the identified baseline scenario, ensuring alignment with the applied methodology and pertinent tools."

        "generation": "The data and parameters monitored during the project crediting period are summarized in the table above. The initial focus is on tracking the efficiency of biomass-fired cook stoves utilized for cooking purposes, measured in tonnes per hectare per year. The values include combustion efficiency for both improved and traditional cook stoves, along with the emission factors applied. Data is sourced from the Project Design Document Version 04, with measurement methods elaborated in the Monitoring Plan section. Quality assurance and quality control procedures are outlined in section B.7.1 of the Project Design Document, aiming at calculating baseline emissions concerning cook stove efficiency. Please proceed with completing the table for any additional monitored data and parameters required throughout the project crediting period."
