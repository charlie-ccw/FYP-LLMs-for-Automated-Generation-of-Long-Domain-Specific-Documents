        "generation": "In the project context, the baseline scenario is defined as the persistent use of non-renewable wood fuel, specifically firewood, by the target population to fulfill similar thermal energy needs as met by the project cookstoves in the absence of project intervention. This determination is supported by the registration records and consent deeds of individual Improved Cookstoves (ICS) users, capturing crucial details such as geographical coordinates, addresses, and explicit confirmation by end users regarding their previous reliance on traditional cooking methods. The methodology employed involves a series of sequential steps, starting with emission reductions computation, followed by calculation method application, and culminating in the determination of average woody biomass consumption of sample stoves extrapolated to the entire stove user population. Each meticulous step in the methodology verifies the ongoing use of non-renewable wood fuel by the target demographic to meet similar thermal energy demands as facilitated by project cookstoves in the absence of project activities, consistently reaffirming the prevalent reliance on non-renewable wood fuel for cooking within the community. Key assumptions include the use of a cloud-based database management system through a mobile application for data collection, adherence to the 'Standard for Sampling and Surveys for CDM Project Activities and Programme of Activities' for sample size determination, ensuring sample households' representativeness compared to the broader project population, and random sample selection with a 90% confidence level and a 10% margin of error from the target group. These assumptions are justified by the distinction between woody biomass consumption and renewable biomass, leading to the estimation of non-renewable biomass utilization in Bangladesh. Methodological decisions involve the application of specific high-power thermal efficiency criteria for the project stove, selection of five distinct ICS models with varying efficiencies, sample size determination based on established standards, and comparison of non-renewable biomass estimates with deforestation data. The selection of VCS approved methodology VMR0006: Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves, Version 1.1, is warranted to assess emission reductions resulting from the project activity. Supporting references include the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 report, Bangladesh Sample Vital Statistics 2020, a report on Market-Based Solutions and Access to Finance Options for Clean Cooking Technologies in Bangladesh, and a report on women's right to clean air in Bangladesh.
