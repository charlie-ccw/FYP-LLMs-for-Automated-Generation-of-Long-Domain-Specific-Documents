The proposed project involves deployment of ICS only in households.\n\n2. The project stove shall have specified high power thermal efficiency of at least 25% per the manufacturer\u2019s specifications and shall exclusively use woody biomass and can be single pot or multi-pot; The TK90 and ecozen stoves planned to be installed under this project are single pot wood cookstoves that have an efficiency of 30.25% and 38.4% respectively as per the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\n\n3. Both \u2018Projects\u2019 and \u2018Large Projects\u2019 can use the methodology Estimated average annual emission reductions of the first project activity is 56,635 tonne CO2 per year which smaller than 300,000 tonnes CO2e per year. Therefore, proposed project qualifies the \u201cProjects\u201d criteria.\n\n4. Non-renewable biomass has been used in the project region since 31 December 1989, using survey methods or referring to published literature, official reports or statistics. According to FAO data, the total forest cover in Viet Nam has decreased since 1990. Global Forest Resources Assessment Country Report (2015) revealed that the total forest area has been declining, as indicated in the table below:\n\nTable: Trends in carbon stock in living forest biomass 1990 - 2015\n\n1990 2000 2005 2010 2015 778 927 964 986 1025\n\nFurther as per Global Forest Watch, from 2002 to 2022, Vietnam lost 740 kha of humid primary forest, making up 22% of its total tree cover loss in the same time period. Total area of humid primary forest in Vietnam decreased by 11% in this time period.\n\nRefer to Vietnam forest fact and figures, between 1990 and 2000, Viet Nam gained an average of 236,200 hectares of forest per year. The amounts to an average annual reforestation rate of 2.52%. Between 2000 and 2005, the rate of forest change decreased by 18.5% to 2.06% per annum. In total, between 1990 and 2005, Viet Nam gained 38.1% of its forest cover, or around 3,568,000 hectares. Viet Nam lost 299,000 hectares of its primary forest cover during that time. Deforestation rates of primary cover have decreased 77.9% since the close of the 1990s.\n\nBased on the findings above, one can reasonably assume that Non-Renewable Biomass has been used before 1989 thereby hinting that fuelwood used across Viet Nam comes from non-renewable sources\n\n5. For the specific case of biomass residues processed as a fuel (e.g. briquettes, wood chips), it shall be demonstrated that: (a) It is produced using exclusively renewable biomass (more than one type of biomass may be used). (b) The consumption of the fuel should be monitored during the crediting period and (c) Energy use for renewable biomass processing (e.g., shredding and compacting in the case of briquetting) may be considered as equivalent to the upstream emissions associated with the processing of the displaced fossil fuel and hence disregarded. Not applicable. The ICS is introduced as energy efficiency measure to replace baseline stoves and reduce the use of non-renewable biomass for combustion, do not use biomass residues processed.\n\n6. The PD shall explain the proposed method for distribution of project devices including the method to avoid double counting of emission reductions such as unique identifications of product and end-user locations (e.g. programme logo). Each ICS in this project will be identified by a unique combination of customer name and geographical location, as well as a serial number. The serial number will be a unique number which will allow for a clear distinction between the stoves. No individual serial number can be repeated within the project, thus ensuring that each stove is counted only once in the proposed project. In addition, the project has been cross-checked against other CDM project activity operating in the country using the UNFCCC, the Gold Standard, and other relevant voluntary carbon schemes to ensure that the ICS is not included in any other CDM project activity or voluntary project activity.\n\n7. The PD shall also explain how the proposed procedures prevent double counting of emission reductions, for example to avoid that project stove manufacturers, wholesale providers or others claim credit for emission reductions from the project devices. All users of ICSs sign a Beneficiary Agreement that cedes all rights to VRs to the project proponent. Therefore, only the project proponent is able to claim credit for emissions reductions from the project devices.\n\n# Table 3.2.

        "generation": "## Monitoring Plan\n\n### Introduction\nThis monitoring plan delineates the systematic process and timetable for acquiring, documenting, consolidating, and scrutinizing the monitored data and parameters as delineated in Section 5.2 (Data and Parameters Monitored). This document presents a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, organizational framework, duties, and protocols associated with monitoring activities, internal audits, QA/QC, managing non-conformities, and sampling methodologies.\n\n### Methods for Data Measurement and Documentation\nThe monitoring techniques encompass direct measurements or sampling based on representative samples. Sampling criteria are applied to ascertain sample sizes achieving a 95/10 confidence precision level. Monitoring and documentation should be conducted biennially to ensure precise data collection for baseline emissions calculations.\n\n### Data Storage and Reporting\nCollected data will be securely stored and aggregated for streamlined analysis. Compilation and reporting will be executed methodically to ensure transparency and precision. Procedures for calibrating monitoring equipment will be implemented to sustain measurement accuracy and dependability.\n\n### Organizational Framework and Personnel Responsibilities\nThe monitoring tasks will be carried out by personnel appointed by the Project Proponent (PP). Duties encompass periodic audits, surveillance, spot checks, and post-installation maintenance services to guarantee the correct operation and efficacy of distributed stoves as stipulated by the manufacturer.\n\n### Internal Auditing and QA/QC Protocols\nScheduled audits and surveillance will be conducted to oversee stove performance throughout the project duration. Spot checks and maintenance services will be enforced to uphold the specified efficiencies of the project stoves. These protocols aim to uphold quality control and ensure adherence to the monitoring plan.\n\n### Handling Non-Conformities\nIn instances of non-compliance with the sanctioned monitoring plan, scheduled audits and surveillance will be intensified to promptly address issues. Spot checks and maintenance services will be pivotal in rectifying deviations from the established monitoring procedures and efficiency standards.\n\n### Sampling Approaches\nStratified random sampling techniques will be utilized, taking into account occupancy and demographic variances in the sampling framework. Sample size computations will target a 95/10 confidence/precision level for annual sampling. With an anticipated population size of 600,000 households and a monitoring frequency of at least once every two years, the sampling strategy aims to capture a representative dataset for analysis.\n\n### GHG Data Collection System\nSchematic diagrams will be employed to elucidate the GHG data collection and management system, offering a visual representation of the monitoring processes and data flow within the project structure.\n\nThis monitoring plan encompasses a structured approach to data collection, analysis, and reporting, supported by robust organizational structures, quality control measures, and sampling strategies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of monitored parameters."
