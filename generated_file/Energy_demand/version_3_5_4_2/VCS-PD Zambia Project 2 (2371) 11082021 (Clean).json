These cookstoves are designed to enhance wood burning efficiency, improve thermal transfer to pots, and reduce fuel consumption. The key objectives of the project are to combat deforestation, minimize indoor smoke pollution, and reduce the time spent on firewood collection.\n\n### Technologies/Measures to be Implemented\n\nThe project will focus on the distribution of fuel-efficient improved cookstoves, specifically the single pot TLC-CQC Rocket Stove. These stoves are designed to burn wood more efficiently, improve thermal transfer, and save fuel. By promoting the adoption of these cookstoves, the project aims to mitigate the environmental impact of traditional cooking methods.\n\n### Location of the Project\n\nThe project is situated in Zambia, with specific coordinates at 13\u00b008'02.0\"S latitude and 27\u00b050'57.6\"E longitude. Zambia serves as the primary location for the implementation of this initiative to address environmental and health challenges associated with traditional cooking practices.\n\n### Expected GHG Emission Reductions and Carbon Dioxide Removals\n\nThe project anticipates an average annual GHG emission reduction of 6.79 t CO2e per year for each instance of project activity. The overall goal is to achieve a total reduction of 1,713,078 t CO2e throughout the crediting period by distributing fuel-efficient improved cookstoves. By promoting sustainable cooking practices, the project aims to contribute significantly to carbon dioxide removal efforts.\n\n### Scenario Prior to Project Implementation\n\nBefore the project's initiation, the target population predominantly relied on non-renewable wood fuel (firewood) for their thermal energy requirements. This reliance led to deforestation and elevated levels of indoor smoke pollution, posing environmental and health risks to the community.\n\n### Estimate of Annual Average and Total Reductions and Removals\n\nThe project estimates an annual average GHG emission reduction of 6.79 t CO2e per year for each project activity instance. The cumulative reduction for the collective project activities over the entire crediting period is projected to reach 1,713,078 t CO2e. These reductions and removals signify the positive impact of the project in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices."
