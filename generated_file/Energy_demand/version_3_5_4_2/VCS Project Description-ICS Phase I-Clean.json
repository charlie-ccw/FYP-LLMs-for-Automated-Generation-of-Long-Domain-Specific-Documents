This document offers a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, organizational setup, internal auditing protocols, non-conformance resolution strategies, sampling methodologies, and potential schematic representations for the GHG data collection and management system.\n\n## Methods for Data Monitoring and Management\n### Measurement, Recording, Storage, Aggregation, and Reporting\n- **Measurement and Recording**: Monitored data is efficiently stored digitally through a mobile application.\n- **Storage**: Thorough records of ICS beneficiaries are meticulously upheld with unique identification numbers and agreements.\n- **Aggregation and Compilation**: Data is consolidated and electronically stored for convenient access and analysis.\n- **Reporting**: Scheduled ICS distribution, collection of user evidence, necessary ICS repairs, and essential information on ICS utilization.\n- **Calibration Procedures**: Specific calibration procedures are not explicitly outlined.\n\n## Organizational Structure and Responsibilities\n- **Roles**: Oversight of monitoring activities by the ICS Project Incharge, Distribution Team, and Operation & Maintenance team.\n- **Responsibilities**:\n  - Designing the monitoring system.\n  - Data consolidation and storage.\n  - ICS distribution.\n  - Supporting evidence collection.\n  - ICS repairs.\n  - Data collection and reporting.\n\n## Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures\n- **Internal Auditing**:\n  - Designing the monitoring system.\n  - Electronically consolidating and storing data.\n  - Generating monitoring reports.\n  - Ensuring timely ICS distribution.\n  - Collecting evidence from ICS users.\n  - Addressing reported issues and conducting repairs.\n  - Collecting and reporting Operation & Maintenance data.\n\n## Handling Non-Conformances\n- **Non-Conformance Handling**:\n  - Preventing double counting of emission reductions.\n  - Ensuring project participants do not claim credits for distributed ICS under the project.\n\n## Sampling Approaches\n- **Sample Size and Precision**:\n  - Biennial sampling necessitates a minimum sample size of 171 with 95/5 confidence/precision.\n  - Annual sampling requires a minimum sample size of 43 with 95/10 confidence/precision.\n- **Selection**: Random sampling from each Primary Sampling Unit.\n- **QA/QC Procedures**: Detailed QA/QC procedures are not explicitly specified.\n\n## Line Diagrams\n- **GHG Data Collection and Management System**: While a project boundary representation is present, specific line diagrams illustrating the GHG data collection and management system are not explicitly detailed.\n\nThis monitoring plan offers a well-structured framework for the efficient collection, management, and analysis of monitored data and parameters, ensuring adherence to the prescribed procedures and standards."
