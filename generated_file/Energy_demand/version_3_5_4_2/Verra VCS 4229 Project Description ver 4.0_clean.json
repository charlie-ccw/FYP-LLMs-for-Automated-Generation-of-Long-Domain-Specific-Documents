These energy-efficient cookstoves are intended to improve cooking efficiency, save time, and reduce fuel consumption, with a special emphasis on empowering women to reallocate saved time to more productive endeavors. Additionally, the project seeks to elevate the status of unpaid care and domestic work through the enhancement of public services, infrastructure, and social protection policies. The project strategy revolves around the replacement of traditional, inefficient stoves with ICS in households and communities across India to curtail GHG emissions associated with non-renewable biomass use. By facilitating the adoption of these energy-efficient cookstoves, the project anticipates a substantial reduction in GHG emissions related to cooking practices. The project's geographical scope extends across all states and cities in India, with Maharashtra state serving as a focal point. Prior to the project's commencement, the prevalent cooking practices in India relied heavily on non-renewable biomass and inefficient traditional stoves. The expected impact of the project includes an annual average GHG emission reduction of 2,297,154 tCO2e and a total reduction of 16,080,078 tCO2e over seven years. Through these initiatives, the project aims to significantly lower GHG emissions, promote environmental sustainability, and encourage the adoption of cleaner and more efficient cooking technologies nationwide."
