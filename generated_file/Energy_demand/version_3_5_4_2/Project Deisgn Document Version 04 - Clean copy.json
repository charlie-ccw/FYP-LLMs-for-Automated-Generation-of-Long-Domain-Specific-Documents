By transitioning to these improved cook stoves, the project targets significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promotes carbon dioxide removal. The estimated annual average GHG emissions reduction is 12,945 tCO2e, with a total reduction of 129,450 tCO2e over the project's fixed crediting period. Advanced manufacturing technologies, including die casting for the top plate made from cast iron, are utilized in the production process. Various materials like cast iron, mild steel, and iron and steel are employed, adhering to the IS13152 (Part 1): 1991 standards for Solid Biomass - Chulha Part 1(Metallic). The current system operates at an efficiency of 29.88%, a significant improvement over traditional stoves that typically operate at 10% efficiency. Services provided by the systems and equipment include maintenance, repair, and upgrades, catering to both basic and intricate requirements. The baseline scenario comparison highlights that without the project, traditional stoves, kerosene, LPG, or biomass-based improved cook stoves would have been the primary cooking options. Prior to project implementation, thermal energy needs were primarily met using fossil fuels, and households in the target rural areas had access to various cooking options.

Understanding the baseline scenario is essential as it forms the basis for evaluating the project's impact. Let's examine the critical elements in detail.\n\n### Baseline Scenario Overview\nThe baseline scenario, as determined by the applied methodology, focuses on the utilization of fossil fuels to meet thermal energy requirements similar to those of the project. This scenario acts as a reference point for assessing the project's effects.\n\n### Procedure Steps and Implementation\nThe methodology involves replacing conventional cook stoves with improved models. Each step includes adjusting the baseline fuel wood consumption by a net to gross factor of 0.95 to address potential leakages. Moreover, the project aims to replace traditional cook stoves with enhanced alternatives.\n\n### Key Assumptions and Justification\nKey assumptions of the baseline scenario include the preference for biomass in traditional cook stoves due to its suitability for the target population. These assumptions are supported by concerns over unsustainable firewood extraction and the imbalance between fuel wood supply and demand.\n\n### Methodological Choices and Validation\nThe methodological decisions center on substituting traditional cook stoves with improved biomass-fired versions for cooking activities. These choices are corroborated by various studies, such as those conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Forest Survey of India, and the National Council for Applied Economic Research.\n\n### Relevant Citations\nReferences from the TERI 1998 publication are crucial in supporting the baseline scenario, key assumptions, and methodological selections, providing a solid basis for the project's structure.\n\nBy meticulously identifying and justifying the baseline scenario, we establish a strong foundation for evaluating the project's outcomes and impact.

It is noteworthy that the project activities are not legally mandated and do not fall under any enforced laws or regulations of the host country pertaining to this specific initiative. For instance, there is no stipulation requiring an environmental impact assessment study for the adoption of Improved Cook stoves.\n\n### Approaches to Demonstrating Additionality\nThe project's additionality is substantiated through the application of the consolidated baseline methodology concerning 'Energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass.' This methodology primarily targets the replacement of traditional cook stoves with improved models. The chosen method for showcasing additionality is Investment Analysis, which involves a systematic approach to presenting the outcomes of each phase. The identified barriers encompass factors such as competition for biomass, accessibility to commercial energy sources, commercial fuel costs, inadequate rural supply, limited LPG production capacity, and the economic feasibility of commercial fuel for specific demographic segments.\n\nThe credibility of these barriers is supported by empirical evidence, including unsustainable fuel wood extraction practices due to the disparity between demand and production. Various studies and reports underscore the scarcity of fuel wood in the region, underscoring the gravity of the situation. Moreover, the project employs a performance-based approach to exhibit additionality by distributing higher efficiency biomass-fired cook stoves and replacing traditional variants with enhanced models.\n\n### Reproducibility and Citations\nThe document furnishes all essential data and parameters required for replicating the additionality analysis and attaining consistent outcomes.
