Rather than separately assessing baseline emissions and project emissions, the focus lies on determining the net emission reductions accomplished by the project.\n\n**Procedure for Emission Quantification**\n\nThe methodology does not isolate baseline emissions or project emissions but concentrates on computing net emission reductions. Leakage is assumed at 0.95 by default. The calculation of emission reductions encompasses factors like woody biomass savings, non-renewable biomass fraction, calorific value, and other pertinent variables.\n\n**Carbon Stock Alterations**\n\nThe methodology for quantifying carbon stock changes incorporates specific equations and variables such as the saved woody biomass quantity, non-renewable biomass fraction, net calorific value of the biomass, and CO2 emission factors.\n\n**Reductions and Eliminations**\n\nThe project quantifies net emission reductions achieved without distinguishing between baseline emissions and project emissions. Various parameters linked to improved cook stoves are integrated into the formula. The project boundary is defined as the geographical area where households receive the improved cook stoves, adhering strictly to the methodology.\n\n**Utilized Equations**\n\nThe primary equation employed in the quantification process is the formula for calculating emission reductions (ERs) as per the methodology. This equation includes variables such as saved woody biomass quantity, non-renewable biomass fraction, net calorific value of non-renewable woody biomass, and CO2 emission factors for fossil fuels.\n\n**Data Reproduction Details**\n\nThe calculation of the non-renewable biomass fraction (fNRB) for the project region in India is based on the proportion of renewable and non-renewable woody biomass in the total wood biomass consumption. The specified fNRB value of 0.8030 is derived from computed data utilizing 'TOOL30: Calculation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass.'\n\n**Justification for Methodological Choices**\n\nThe utilization of TOOL30 is substantiated for project participants to compute project-specific fNRB values by evaluating the biomass sourcing region for end-users included in the project activity. The rationale behind selecting the area is documented in the project design documents.\n\n**Incorporation of Calculation Spreadsheet**\n\nAll computations, including those for emission reduction and removal, are encompassed in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet detailed in Section 4.4 of the project description.
