Subsequently, data is consolidated in a database spreadsheet and analyzed in accordance with project specifications and methodological algorithms.\n\n**Internal Auditing and Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures**\n\nDetailed procedures for internal auditing are not explicitly delineated in the provided information.\n\n**Non-Conformance Management**\n\nNon-conformances with the validated monitoring plan are rectified by utilizing a predetermined value obtained from the WBT survey conducted on a three-stone fire system using firewood, set at 11.27% ex-ante and consistently maintained throughout the crediting period.\n\n**Sampling Approaches**\n\nSampling strategies entail the selection of 150 households across two municipalities for the baseline survey. For ongoing monitoring, data is collected from a statistically significant sample of ICS units in the database following a pre-defined sampling plan. The sampling targets beneficiaries in villages that have received the ICS based on distribution batches.\n\n**Schematic Diagrams**\n\nSpecific details regarding schematic diagrams for the GHG data collection and management system are not provided.\n\nBy adhering to these delineated processes and protocols, the project ensures precise data collection, robust analysis, and efficient monitoring of critical parameters to bolster emission reduction objectives."
