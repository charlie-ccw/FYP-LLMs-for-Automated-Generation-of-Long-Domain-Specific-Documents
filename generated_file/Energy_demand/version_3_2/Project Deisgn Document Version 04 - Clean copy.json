This document provides a comprehensive outline of the quantification procedure aligned with the applied methodology, AMS II-G, Version 04.0.0.\n\n**Procedure Overview:**\n\n1. **Baseline Emissions Quantification:** The initial step involves assessing the baseline emissions linked to the traditional cook stoves being substituted by improved alternatives, including evaluating the efficiency of the outdated system.\n\n2. **Project Emissions Assessment:** Subsequently, the focus shifts to quantifying the project emissions associated with the introduction of improved cook stoves, encompassing an evaluation of the efficiency of the new system.\n\n3. **Leakage Calculation:** The quantification process also considers leakage, which accounts for any inadvertent emission increases beyond the project boundary.\n\n4. **Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals:** By deducting project emissions from baseline emissions and factoring in potential leakage, the net GHG emission reductions and removals are determined. The methodology applied includes equations for distinguishing between reductions and removals if required.\n\n**Equations Used:**\n\n- Efficiency of the old system: \\(Efficiency_{old} = \\frac{Useful Energy Output_{old}}{Total Energy Input_{old}}\\)\n- Efficiency of the new system: \\(Efficiency_{new} = \\frac{Useful Energy Output_{new}}{Total Energy Input_{new}}\\)\n- Fraction of woody biomass saved: \\(fNRB = NRB - DRB\\)\n\n**Methodological Choices Justification:**\n\nThe selection of the Consolidated Baseline Methodology for 'Energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass' (AMS II-G) is substantiated by the project's objective to curb greenhouse gas emissions through the dissemination of improved cook stoves. This methodology accounts for baselines, default emission factors, and efficiency enhancements resulting from the transition to modern cook stoves.\n\n**Reproduction Information:**\n\nThe provided reproduction information details the determination of system efficiencies, calculation of the fraction of woody biomass saved, and criteria for validating Demonstrably Renewable Biomass (DRB) as renewable. Additionally, it addresses trends in forest area, indicators of carbon stock depletion, and fuel wood price trends.\n\n**Inclusion of Calculations:**\n\nAll calculations pertinent to emission reductions and removals are integrated into the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet, as confirmed in the Project Design Document (PDD) of the UNFCCC registered CDM project reference no. 9501.\n\nBy adhering to the outlined procedure and equations, stakeholders can precisely quantify project emissions and carbon stock changes, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in assessing the environmental benefits of the project activity."
