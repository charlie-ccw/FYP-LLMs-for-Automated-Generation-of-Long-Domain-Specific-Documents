These stoves are intended to replace traditional cooking methods in rural areas of Kolhapur, Sindhudurg, and Ratnagiri districts within Pune and Konkan Division, Maharashtra. Targeting 14,046 households, the project anticipates an annual reduction of 12,627 tCO2e in greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation schedule involves a phased distribution of these improved cook stoves to households falling under the BPL and Scheduled Tribes categories. To ensure successful deployment, the project has already finalized end-user Tripartite Agreements. The primary technology utilized in this initiative is the improved cook stove, designed to optimize energy efficiency during cooking activities. By transitioning from conventional stoves to these improved versions, the project aims to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for sustainable cooking practices. Information regarding the age and lifespan of the equipment is currently unavailable. The project emphasizes sustainable fuel wood extraction from forest areas to sustain the operation of the improved cook stoves. Forecasted installed capacities for various forest types have been established to ensure a consistent and eco-friendly fuel supply for households. The installed systems and equipment enhance energy efficiency in thermal applications, particularly in biomass utilization for cooking purposes. These improved cook stoves offer superior efficiency levels compared to traditional alternatives, resulting in reduced carbon emissions. The project's scope encompasses households equipped with the improved cook stoves in the specified districts. By introducing efficient biomass-fired cook stoves, the project aims to enhance cooking practices and reduce dependence on less sustainable fuel sources. In the absence of the project, households would continue using traditional cook stoves, kerosene, LPG, or biomass-based alternatives for cooking. The introduction of improved cook stoves signifies a significant shift towards more sustainable and environmentally conscious cooking practices. The project boundary includes all households where the improved cook stoves have been installed in the target districts of Maharashtra. By promoting these efficient cooking technologies, the project contributes to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and fostering sustainable energy practices in the region."

        "generation": "In line with the provisions of the chosen methodology, AMS - II.G; 'Energy Efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass', EB 68, Version 04, the baseline of the project activity pertains to the use of fossil fuels for meeting similar thermal energy needs. In the absence of the project activity, beneficiaries could have opted for traditional stoves, kerosene, LPG, or biomass-based improved cook stoves for cooking purposes. Although the regulations of the host country permit the use of all these options for cooking, certain barriers exist, particularly in rural areas, hindering the adoption of some fuel options as highlighted in a study by the National Institute of Science, Technology & Development Studies (NISTADS), CSIR, New Delhi. The study underscores the challenges faced by poor rural households in affording and choosing improved cook stoves due to the availability of free wood. This reluctance to opt for improved stoves is further emphasized by the fact that households preferring improved stoves do so mainly for subsidy reasons. The statistics reveal a significant reliance on firewood for cooking in rural areas of Maharashtra, indicating a prevalent trend. The publication 'Household Energy and the Environment' notes a shift towards commercial fuels nationally but minimal progress in rural areas where energy consumption is dictated by various factors such as biomass availability, competing uses, commercial energy source accessibility, and cost considerations. Additionally, the issues of affordability of commercial fuels, especially among the Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations, further deter the use of LPG or Kerosene as baseline options. Consequently, the use of biomass in traditional cook stoves emerges as the most feasible baseline option for the target population. The methodology specifies the baseline and recommends a baseline emission factor, thereby precluding the need for an assessment of alternatives for determining the baseline and emission factor. As per the methodology, an default emission factor of 81.6 tCO2e/TJ is utilized for estimating emission reductions, calculated based on the quantity of woody biomass saved, the fraction of non-renewable biomass saved, the net calorific value of the biomass, and the emission factor for the substitution of non-renewable woody biomass. The determination of the quantity of woody biomass saved is based on historical data or surveys of local usage, with an estimated annual consumption of firewood per household in Maharashtra considered as 1.469 tonnes. The efficiency values of the old and new systems, along with the fraction of non-renewable woody biomass saved, are calculated in accordance with the methodology. The fraction of non-renewable biomass is determined by the project participants using approved methods, considering the shares of renewable and non-renewable woody biomass in the total biomass consumption. The methodology further outlines the conditions for justifying Demonstrably Renewable Biomass (DRB) and Non-Renewable Biomass (NRB) components, ensuring that the project activities adhere to sustainable practices. The demand for fuel wood in Maharashtra is estimated based on the percentage of rural population relying on firewood and the average per-capita fuel wood consumption, indicating a substantial requirement for firewood. The sustainable extraction potential from forest areas and tree outside forest land is assessed to determine the renewable biomass available for extraction, with the estimation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass based on the total renewable biomass available. Two supporting indicators, including the depletion of carbon stocks and the increase in fuel wood prices, are established to validate the fraction of non-renewable biomass, indicating the need for sustainable practices and the potential scarcity of fuel wood resources due to increasing demand and unsustainable extraction practices."

This persistent gap, influenced by population growth and unsustainable practices, serves as a critical benchmark for assessing the project's effectiveness and impact.\n\n**Methodological Approach and Procedure**\n\nThe project methodology entails replacing traditional cook stoves with improved ones to boost energy efficiency. Aligned with AMS-II.G, a small-scale approach is adopted, targeting 14,046 households in specific Maharashtra districts. The systematic deployment of improved cook stoves is aimed at enhancing energy conservation and curbing environmental degradation.\n\n**Key Assumptions and Rationale**\n\nCentral assumptions include acknowledging the demand-supply gap for sustainable fuel wood exacerbated by demographic shifts and deforestation. The project's adherence to AMS-II.G criteria is justified by its focus on households adopting efficient cook stoves in selected districts. The rationale behind these decisions lies in advancing clean cooking practices, reducing indoor air pollution-related health risks, and fostering sustainable energy use among marginalized communities.\n\n**Methodological Choices and References**\n\nThe selection of AMS-II.G methodology is substantiated by its alignment with project goals and beneficiaries. Detailed references supporting assumptions, rationale, and methodological decisions are available in Project Design Document Version 04, specifically in sections outlining greenhouse gas emission reductions and removal quantification.\n\nBy meticulously following the prescribed methodology and substantiating key assumptions and choices, the project aims to significantly impact sustainable energy practices and enhance the well-being of vulnerable communities in Maharashtra."
