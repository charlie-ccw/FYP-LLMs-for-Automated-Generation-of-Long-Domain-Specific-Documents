        "generation": "**Project Overview**\n\nThe primary objective of the project is the widespread distribution of energy-efficient Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) in rural households in Odisha and Jharkhand. By replacing traditional cookstoves with ICS, the project aims to enhance efficiency in thermal applications, thereby reducing firewood consumption and promoting sustainable cooking practices.\n\n**Implemented Technologies and Measures**\n\nThe core focus of the project lies in the deployment of high-efficiency Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) to replace conventional cookstoves. These modern stoves offer superior efficiency and emission parameters compared to the baseline, contributing significantly to sustainable development by curbing the demand for fuel wood in households.\n\n**Project Location**\n\nThe project activities will be concentrated within the geographic boundaries of Odisha and Jharkhand. In Odisha, the project spans from 17\u00b049'N to 22\u00b034'N latitudes and 81\u00b027'E to 87\u00b029'E longitudes, while in Jharkhand, it extends from 21\u00b057' to 25\u00b014' N latitude and 83\u00b020' to 87\u00b058'E longitude.\n\n**Expected GHG Emission Reductions**\n\nAnticipated to yield an average annual GHG emission reduction/removal of 2,48,379 tCO2e, the project's primary focus is on mitigating emissions through the adoption of improved cooking solutions in rural households. By transitioning away from traditional three-stone cookstoves towards ICS, the project aims to minimize emissions associated with inefficient biomass combustion.\n\n**Pre-Implementation Scenario**\n\nPrior to project initiation, households in the target regions relied on inefficient traditional cookstoves, leading to heightened emissions. The prevalent use of biomass without adequate ventilation or combustion mechanisms resulted in escalated firewood consumption and associated environmental impacts.\n\n**Estimated Annual and Total Emission Reductions**\n\nThe projected annual GHG emission reductions for Project Instance 1 and Project Instance 2 are 2,48,379 tCO2e/year and 2,60,689 tCO2e/year, respectively. Over the project's lifespan, a total reduction of 18,24,821 tCO2e is expected, underscoring the substantial environmental benefits and sustainable outcomes of the initiative."

Ltd and CSIR-Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology (IMMT), Odisha. For example, the ICS model from Swami Samarth Electronics Pvt. Ltd is the Agneekaa Eco Mini Cook Stove, characterized by features such as secondary air supply through natural draft, body crafted from galvanized iron sheet, combustion chamber constructed from stainless steel SS 202 grade, insulating material comprising thermal wool, and a top plate made of stainless steel SS 202 grade.\n\nThe anticipated lifespan of each cook stove is estimated at 7 years based on the manufacturer's specifications and industry norms.\n\n**Services Offered and Interconnection with Other Equipment**\n\nThe project's primary objective is to enhance thermal efficiency by introducing energy-efficient ICS in households to supplant traditional cookstoves. This endeavor is designed to diminish firewood consumption, extend clean energy accessibility to rural and peri-urban communities in India. Each ICS is uniquely identified to prevent duplication of emission reductions, ensuring transparency and answerability.\n\n**Baseline Situation and Current Infrastructure**\n\nIn the absence of the project activity, the prevailing service provision would persist with the utilization of non-renewable wood fuel or fossil fuel by the target demographic to fulfill analogous thermal energy requirements addressed by the project cook stoves. Preceding project implementation, households relied on traditional three-stone cookstoves lacking improved combustion mechanisms or ventilation, with biomass serving as the primary fuel source. The project instances have concentrated on disseminating energy-efficient ICS in regions like Odisha and Jharkhand, with future expansion plans encompassing additional areas within India."
