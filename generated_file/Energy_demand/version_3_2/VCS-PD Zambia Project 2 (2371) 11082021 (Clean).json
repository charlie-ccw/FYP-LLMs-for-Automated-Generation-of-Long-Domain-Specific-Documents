The reporting provisions encompass detailed data on participating households, unique serial numbers for emission reduction attribution, leakage assessment, and transparent monitoring reporting processes.\n\nIn conclusion, the VCS-PD Zambia Project 2's distribution of fuel-efficient improved cookstoves not only addresses environmental concerns but also contributes significantly to social and economic sustainability in Zambia, aligning with national sustainable development priorities and ensuring effective monitoring and reporting mechanisms for long-term impact assessment."

        "generation": "**Document Title: Compliance with Applicability Conditions of Methodology VMR0006**\n\nIn accordance with Methodology ID VMR0006, the project activity must adhere to specific applicability conditions to ensure compliance with the methodology. The following justifications demonstrate how the project meets each of these applicability conditions:\n\n**Applicability Condition:**\nProject activities shall be implemented in domestic premises or in community-based kitchen.\n\n**How the project complies:**\nThe proposed project involves deployment of ICS only in households. The project stove shall have specified high-power thermal efficiency of at least 25% per the manufacturer\u2019s specifications and shall exclusively use woody biomass and can be single pot or multi-pot. The TLC-CQC Rocket stoves planned to be installed under this project are single pot wood cookstoves that have an efficiency of 34.5% as per the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\n\nBoth \u2018Projects\u2019 and \u2018Large Projects\u2019 can use the methodology. Estimated average annual emission reductions for the grouped project activity are greater than 300,000 tonnes CO2e per year. Therefore, the proposed project qualifies the \u201cLarge Projects\u201d criteria.\n\nNon-renewable biomass has been used in the project region since 31 December 1989, using survey methods or referring to published literature, official reports or statistics. Non-renewable biomass has been used since 31 December 1989 in Malawi as demonstrated below.\n\nFor the specific case of biomass residues processed as a fuel (e.g., briquettes, wood chips), it shall be demonstrated that: (a) It is produced using exclusively renewable biomass (more than one type of biomass may be used). (b) The consumption of the fuel should be monitored during the crediting period and (c) Energy use for renewable biomass processing (e.g., shredding and compacting in the case of briquetting) may be considered as equivalent to the upstream emissions associated with the processing of the displaced fossil fuel and hence disregarded.\n\nNot applicable. The ICS is introduced as an energy efficiency measure to replace baseline stoves and reduce the use of non-renewable biomass for combustion.\n\nThe project design shall explain the proposed method for distribution of project devices including the method to avoid double counting of emission reductions such as unique identifications of product and end-user locations (e.g., programme logo).\n\nEach ICS in this project will be identified by a unique combination of customer name and geographical location, as well as a serial number. The serial number will be a unique number allowing for a clear distinction between the stoves. No individual serial number can be repeated within the project, ensuring that each stove is counted only once in the proposed project. In addition, the project has been cross-checked against other CDM project activities operating in the country using the UNFCCC, the Gold Standard, and other relevant voluntary carbon schemes to ensure that the ICS is not included in any other CDM project activity or voluntary project activity.\n\nThe project design shall also explain how the proposed procedures prevent double counting of emission reductions, for example to avoid that project stove manufacturers, wholesale providers, or others claim credit for emission reductions from the project devices.\n\nThe stove manufacturers/wholesale providers/end users shall sign an undertaking stating clearly that the PP or an entity authorized by it shall be the sole owner of the VCUs arising from the project.\n\nEvidence that the non-renewable biomass has been in use since 1989.\n\nNon-renewable biomass has been in use since December 31, 1989 as evidenced by various FAO statistical data. The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 (FAO) indicates that forest areas decline yearly, and that the total forest area declined by 27% from 1973 to 2010, as summarized in the table below. It is now estimated that the fraction of non-renewable biomass in total biomass is 94 percent.\n\nTrends in extent of forest 1973-2010 - Malawi\n\nArea (1000 hectares)\n\n1973: 4456\n\n1990: 3863\n\n2000: 3567\n\n2005: 3402\n\n2010: 3237\n\nIn view of the combined evidence of declining forested areas since 1973, trend in loss in carbon stock since 1990, trend in the increased length of time spent for collecting firewood, and presently such a high fraction of non-renewable biomass, it may be deducted that the majority of fuelwood used across Malawi since December 31, 1989 was from non-renewable sources."

Key components include spot checking of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS), monitoring surveys, data quality checks, and comprehensive reporting. The organizational structure assigns roles to the Project Proponent (PP) overseeing Implementers responsible for spot-checking, monitoring, and reporting. Sampling activities are conducted by field personnel from either the CPA Implementer or a third-party entity at the conclusion of each monitoring period. The PP manages the project database and sampling plan for emission reduction calculations. Regular audits are conducted to ensure stove functionality and determine lifespan. Trained personnel are responsible for sampling and monitoring reporting, with the project database tracking monitoring periods, emission reductions, and project status to prevent double counting and ensure data accuracy. Non-conformances with the monitoring plan are addressed through spot-checking, updating the database with field evidence, excluding unused ICS units from calculations, and conducting data quality and consistency checks. The sampling plan determines sample sizes based on parameter estimates, mean values, and standard deviations to meet precision levels. Additional samples may be taken if confidence and precision requirements are not met. Quality control measures address non-sampling errors and interviewer bias to ensure data reliability. Line diagrams illustrating the GHG data collection and management system are included to provide a visual representation of the data flow and management process. By adhering to these procedures and methods, the project can effectively collect, record, compile, and analyze monitored data and parameters to ensure accurate and reliable results for emission reduction calculations and reporting."
