The methodology focuses on calculating emission reductions using specific equations tailored to the project's context.\n\n**Equations for Quantification:**\n\n1. **Emission Reduction (ERy,I,j):**\n   - The equation ERy,I,j = By,savings,i.j x NCVwood fuel x fNRBy x (EFwf,CO2 + EFwf,non CO2) x Ny,i,j x 0.95 is utilized to estimate the emission reduction achieved by the project. \n   - Here, ERy,I,j represents the emission reductions by a specific type i and batch j of improved cookstoves during year y in tCO2e.\n\n2. **Efficiency Estimation (\u03b7new,i,j):**\n   - Equation 5 (\u03b7new,i,j = \u03b7P x (DFn)y-1 x 0.94) is applied to estimate the efficiency of the project stoves, considering various factors such as stove efficiency, discount factor for efficiency loss, and an adjustment factor for uncertainty.\n\n**Annual Calculations:**\nTo enable the reproduction of annual calculations, equations 1 and 2 are employed to calculate the net GHG emission reductions for the project. The formula ERy = \ud835\udf2ei \ud835\udf2ej ERy,I,j is used, where ERy represents the emission reductions during year y in tCO2e.\n\n**Separation of Reductions and Removals:**\nReductions and removals are specified separately in the project description to ensure clarity and prevent double counting of emission reductions, maintaining the integrity of the project's impact assessment.\n\n**Calculation Spreadsheet:**\nThe emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet should encompass methodology deviations, GHG emission quantification, monitored data and parameters, and the monitoring plan to provide a comprehensive overview of the quantification process.\n\n**Vintage Period:**\nThe vintage period refers to the specific time frame for which the emission reductions and removals are calculated, typically aligned with the project crediting period.\n\n**Data and Parameters Monitored:**\nBased on the provided information, the estimated baseline emissions are 638,066 tCO2e/year, and the estimated reduction VCUs are 313,237 tCO2e, with removal VCUs also at 313,237 tCO2e.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy following the outlined procedure, applying the specified equations, and utilizing the provided data and parameters, the quantification of estimated GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals for projects can be accurately achieved, facilitating transparent and reproducible calculations for assessing environmental impact."

        "generation": "**Data / Parameter: Number of beneficiaries due to ICS distribution**\n\n- **Data unit:** Number\n- **Description:** Number of beneficiaries due to Improved Cookstove (ICS) distribution\n- **Source of data:** The data for the number of beneficiaries due to ICS distribution is calculated based on monitored parameters Ny,i,j and Np,HH, with a value applied of 450,000.\n- **Description of measurement methods and procedures to be applied:** The measurement methods involve conducting a monitoring survey using ex post sampling to determine the actual GHG emission reduction achieved by the project activity. Representative sampling will be undertaken to monitor the necessary parameters for GHG emission reductions calculation. No monitoring for leakage through competitive uses of biomass is required, as wood usage is adjusted by 95%. The project will calculate the number of beneficiaries due to ICS distribution based on the monitored parameters Ny,i,j and the number of persons per household Np,HH.\n- **Frequency of monitoring/recording:** At least once in 2 years\n- **Value applied:** 450,000\n- **Monitoring equipment:** None\n- **QA/QC procedures to be applied:** A 95/10 confidence/margin of error shall be achieved for the sampling parameter irrespective of annual/biennial monitoring frequency. If the desired precision is not met, lower bound values shall be used instead of repeating the survey to determine the operational fraction of stoves.\n- **Purpose of data:** Calculation of SDG contribution\n- **Calculation method:** The efficiency of the project stove at the start of the project activity is calculated ex-ante using the equation \u03b7new,i,j = \u03b7P x (DFn)y-1x 0.94.\n- **Comments:** Stakeholders raised questions during the meeting regarding the project activity, such as why Madagascar was chosen for cookstove distribution, how the new cookstove could reduce smoke, and the possibility of using charcoal in the cookstove."

        "generation": "**Data Monitoring and Analysis Procedures**\n\nIn this section, we provide a detailed outline of the comprehensive process and schedule for obtaining, recording, compiling, and analyzing the monitored data and parameters as outlined in Section 5.2 (Data and Parameters Monitored). The methods for measuring, recording, storing, aggregating, collating, and reporting on monitored data and parameters are elaborated upon, along with procedures for calibrating monitoring equipment where applicable.\n\n**Measuring and Recording Methods:**\nThe data measurement methods focus on monitoring the parameter Ny,i,j, encompassing the number of ICS (improved cookstoves) and the number of people per household Np,HH. Monitoring and recording are conducted at least biennially, with a standardized value of 450,000 applied for the number of beneficiaries. Monitoring equipment is not utilized in this process, and specific QA/QC procedures are not specified.\n\n**Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities:**\nThe project's organizational structure includes key roles such as Project Manager, Logistics Manager, Data Administrators, Distribution Team, Monitoring Team, VCS Compliance Manager/Consultant, Technical Review Team, and Local Partner. These roles carry responsibilities for project planning, management, compliance monitoring, data management, distribution oversight, and technical review, ensuring a comprehensive approach to monitoring activities.\n\n**Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures:**\nInternal auditing and QA/QC procedures entail data capture by monitoring teams, followed by checks for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. The project manager then synthesizes the data into a report for the PARS compliance manager, who prepares monitoring reports for each period. Additionally, an in-house technical team conducts a technical review to ensure data integrity.\n\n**Handling Non-Conformances:**\nProcedures for addressing non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan encompass elements such as project database management, ICS spot checks, a sample plan for the monitoring survey, data quality checks, consistency verification, and monitoring reporting. These measures are implemented to effectively resolve any deviations from the established monitoring plan.\n\n**Sampling Approaches and Quality Assurance:**\nThe sampling approach employed integrates Simple Random Sampling for monitored parameters Ny,i,j and \u00b5y,i,j. Visual inspections of premises and interviews with end-users are integral to the sampling process. Sample size determination aims to achieve a 95/10 confidence/precision for annual sampling and 95/5 for biennial sampling, ensuring robust data collection and analysis.\n\n**Line Diagrams for GHG Data Management:**\nLine diagrams are incorporated in the monitoring plan to visually represent the GHG data collection and management system. These diagrams serve to enhance the clarity and understanding of the processes involved in calculating the actual GHG emission reduction achieved through ex post sampling surveys, thereby enriching the monitoring framework."
