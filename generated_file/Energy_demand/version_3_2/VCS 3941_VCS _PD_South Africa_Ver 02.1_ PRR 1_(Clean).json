The primary data to be monitored is the number of project devices of type I and batch j operating during year y. This data will be sourced from monitoring surveys and will be measured directly or based on a representative sample using sampling standards to ensure accuracy. The frequency of monitoring will be at least once every two years to track changes over time. The purpose of collecting this data is for the calculation of emission reductions. The calculation method involves utilizing the equation \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d\u00d7 (\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc66\u22121 \u00d7 0.94 to quantify the estimated reductions and removals for the project crediting period. The monitoring equipment used will include weighing scales to measure the quantity of fuel wood consumed by the project stoves. Quality assurance and quality control procedures are not applicable for this project. The monitoring plan will involve key elements such as data collection procedures, spot-checking of project devices, and preparation of monitoring reports. Overall, the monitoring data and parameters will play a crucial role in evaluating the project's impact on emission reductions and ensuring transparency in reporting."
