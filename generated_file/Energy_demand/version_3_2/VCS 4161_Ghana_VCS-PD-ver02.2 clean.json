This methodology focuses on calculating net emission reductions achieved by the project rather than separately addressing baseline or project emissions. The methodology provides a structured framework for determining emissions reductions by improved cookstoves and the corresponding carbon stock changes. Equations 1 and 2 from the methodology are utilized to compute net GHG emission reductions achieved by the project. Equation (1) estimates the emission reductions by improved cookstoves of a specific type and batch annually, considering various factors. Equation (2) quantifies the amount of woody biomass saved per improved cookstove of a specific type and batch yearly. The efficiency of the improved cookstoves is evaluated through water boiling tests or other specified methods in the methodology. To ensure reproducibility, the project introduces improved cookstoves as an energy efficiency measure, referencing the methodology for the installation of high-efficiency firewood cookstoves and the calculation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass. The sampling frame for the proportion of ICS still in operation and the quantity of woody biomass used by project devices are clearly defined. Simple random sampling is employed for the sampling method, with the sample size determined based on the number of ICS in the database for each monitoring period. The methodology chosen for quantifying GHG emissions reductions and removals does not separately account for baseline emissions, project emissions, or removals but focuses on calculating net emission reductions achieved by the project. Leakage is considered as default 0.95 in accordance with the methodology. While the explicit justification for methodological choices is not provided in the extracted information, the methodology ensures a comprehensive approach to quantifying emission reductions and carbon stock changes. All calculations, including the quantification of emission reductions and removals, are incorporated into the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet as per methodology VMR0006. This spreadsheet serves as a tool to document and track the net emission reductions achieved by the project, aligning with the methodology's approach to quantifying project emissions and carbon stock changes. By adhering to methodology VMR0006 and utilizing the specified equations, the project establishes a systematic and transparent process for quantifying GHG emissions reductions and carbon stock changes, enhancing the initiative's impact in distributing fuel-efficient improved cookstoves in Ghana."

        "generation": "## Quantification of Leakage Emissions Procedure\n\nIn compliance with the methodology VMR0006: Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves v.1.1, quantifying leakage emissions involves utilizing a default value of 0.95. The methodology outlines detailed procedures and formulas for separately computing emission reductions and removals.\n\n### Emission Reductions\nThe formula for calculating emission reductions is as follows:\n\n\\[ ER_{y,i,j} = B_{y,saving,i,j} \\times NCV_{wood\\_fuel} \\times fNRB_{y} \\times (EF_{wf,CO2} + EF_{wf,non CO2}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( B_{y,saving,i,j} \\) = Amount of woody biomass saved per improved cookstove of type i and batch j during year y.\n\n### Emission Removals\nThe methodology provides formulas for computing emission removals, integrating variables such as emission reductions in a specific year, quantity of woody biomass saved per improved cookstove, emission factors for wood fuel, number of improved cookstoves in operation, and a leakage factor of 0.95.\n\n### Methodological Decisions\nThe project strictly follows the methodology without any deviations. It calculates the net emission reductions achieved by the project without distinguishing between baseline emissions and project emissions.\n\n### Emission Factors\nThe project employs CO2 and non-CO2 emission factors for wood fuel based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories:\n- CO2 emission factor: 112 tCO2/TJ\n- Non-CO2 emission factor: 26.23 tCO2/TJ\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\nThe Calculation Spreadsheet contains the computations for net GHG emission reductions and removals using the formulas specified in the methodology 'VMR0006: Methodology for Installation of High Efficiency Firewood Cookstoves, Version 1.1'.\n\nTo replicate the calculations, sample size estimates for parameters Ny,i,j and By=1,new,i, survey need to be determined, taking into account population size, expected proportion, mean values, and standard deviations. Oversampling is recommended for enhanced reliability.\n\nBy adhering to the methodology and equations provided, accurate replication of quantifying leakage emissions and computing emission reductions and removals can be achieved."
