These deviations are necessary to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals while maintaining the conservativeness of the overall impact assessment.\n\nPrevious Deviations:\nIn the initial stages of the project, deviations were made to the monitoring and measurement procedures to address challenges related to data collection and analysis. These deviations were primarily focused on improving the accuracy and reliability of the quantification process without compromising the conservativeness of the results.\n\nCurrent Deviations and Justifications:\nThe current deviation applied to the methodology involves adjusting the frequency of on-site monitoring visits for data collection. Instead of conducting monthly on-site visits as initially planned, the deviation involves reducing the frequency to bi-monthly visits. This adjustment was made to optimize resources and streamline the monitoring process, thereby ensuring that the data collected is still representative and reliable for quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals.\n\nJustification for the Deviation:\n1. The deviation will not negatively impact the conservativeness of the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals: By reducing the frequency of on-site visits to bi-monthly intervals, the project team can still capture sufficient data points to accurately assess the impact of improved cook stoves on GHG emissions. The deviation is justified based on the understanding that the bi-monthly visits will still provide a comprehensive view of the project's progress without compromising the conservativeness of the results.\n\n2. The deviation relates only to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement and does not relate to any other part of the methodology: It is important to note that the deviation is specific to the monitoring and measurement aspect of the project methodology. All other components of the methodology, including the distribution of improved cook stoves, training sessions, and awareness campaigns, remain unchanged. This ensures that the deviation does not affect the core objectives of the project but rather enhances the efficiency of data collection and analysis.\n\nEvidence:\nTo demonstrate the validity of the deviation and its alignment with the section requirement, the project team conducted a thorough impact assessment comparing the data collected through monthly on-site visits versus bi-monthly visits. The analysis revealed that the reduction in monitoring frequency did not significantly alter the quantification of GHG emission reductions or removals. The results remained consistent and reliable, confirming that the deviation does not compromise the accuracy or conservativeness of the methodology.\n\nOverall, the methodology deviations applied in adjusting the monitoring frequency for data collection are justified based on their ability to optimize resources, streamline monitoring procedures, and ensure the continued accuracy of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals."
