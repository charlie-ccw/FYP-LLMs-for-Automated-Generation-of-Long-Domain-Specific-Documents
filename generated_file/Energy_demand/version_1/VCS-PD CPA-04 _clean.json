In the case of the project conducted by Korea Carbon Management Ltd. in Phu Tho Province, Viet Nam, the distribution of 28,000 energy-efficient improved cookstoves to rural households, deviations in monitoring or measurement criteria may have been applied to ensure the project's success. \n\nOne potential deviation that could have been implemented is the adjustment of the frequency of monitoring visits to households receiving the cookstoves. Due to logistical constraints or other practical considerations, it may not always be feasible to conduct monitoring visits as frequently as originally planned in the methodology. This deviation could allow for a more efficient use of resources while still ensuring that the project's objectives are being met.\n\nTo justify this deviation, it is essential to demonstrate that it will not negatively impact the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals. This can be achieved by providing evidence that the reduced frequency of monitoring visits does not compromise the accuracy of data collection or the reliability of the reported emission reductions. For example, alternative methods such as remote monitoring or data validation techniques could be employed to ensure the integrity of the monitoring process despite fewer on-site visits.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to emphasize that any deviations applied relate solely to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement and do not affect other aspects of the methodology. This ensures that the overall integrity and credibility of the project remain intact, with deviations limited to specific operational considerations that do not compromise the project's environmental and social benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, by carefully justifying and providing evidence to support methodology deviations related to monitoring or measurement criteria, the project can adapt to real-world challenges while maintaining the accuracy and conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals.
