These traditional stoves are predominantly inefficient, leading to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide and black carbon, and contributing to indoor air pollution, which poses significant health risks to the population. \n\nTo identify and justify the baseline scenario, the project follows a structured methodology that includes several key steps:\n\n1. **Assessment of Current Situation**: The first step involves conducting a comprehensive assessment of the existing traditional cookstove usage in the target communities. This assessment includes data collection on the types of stoves used, fuel sources, cooking habits, emissions levels, and health impacts associated with traditional stoves.\n\n2. **Quantification of Emissions**: The next step is to quantify the baseline emissions resulting from the use of traditional cookstoves. This involves estimating the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants released into the atmosphere due to inefficient combustion processes.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Health Impacts**: Another critical aspect is to evaluate the health impacts of indoor air pollution caused by traditional cookstoves. This step involves assessing the prevalence of respiratory illnesses, particularly among women and children, who are most exposed to indoor air pollution.\n\n4. **Comparison with International Standards**: The outcomes of the baseline scenario are then compared with international standards and best practices in clean cooking technologies to highlight the gap and the urgent need for intervention.\n\nThe key assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices for establishing the baseline scenario are based on scientific evidence, field surveys, and expert consultations. The rationale behind selecting traditional cookstoves as the focal point is grounded in their significant contribution to environmental degradation and public health concerns in the target communities.\n\nThe methodological choices prioritize a data-driven approach, utilizing quantitative measurements and qualitative assessments to establish a robust baseline scenario. The selection of metrics, such as emissions levels and health indicators, is based on their relevance to the project objectives and the overarching goal of sustainable development.\n\nReferences:\n- World Health Organization.

The project activities, involving the distribution of energy-efficient improved cookstoves, are not mandated by any specific law, statute, or regulatory framework. Therefore, the project does not fall under the category of regulatory surplus as there are no legal obligations requiring the implementation of these activities.\n\n**2. Additionality Methods**\n\nIn demonstrating the additionality of the ReNew Sakhi project, a combination of methods has been employed:\n\n- **Investment Analysis**: The project team conducted a thorough investment analysis to determine the financial viability and necessity of implementing the energy-efficient cookstove distribution. This involved assessing the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the project to ensure that it would not have been financially feasible without the support of carbon finance.\n\n- **Barrier Analysis**: A barrier analysis was also utilized to identify and address key barriers that would have prevented the project from proceeding without external support. The most relevant barriers identified included financial constraints for households to invest in improved cookstoves, lack of awareness about the benefits of energy-efficient cooking solutions, and existing market barriers hindering the adoption of clean cooking technologies. These barriers were substantiated with data on household income levels, surveys on awareness levels, and market research reports.\n\n- **Performance Method**: The project team demonstrated that the performance of the energy-efficient improved cookstoves could achieve a level of emissions reduction and indoor air quality improvement that exceeded the established performance benchmark metric. This was verified through field trials, monitoring data, and comparisons with traditional stove emissions.\n\n- **Activity Method**: The project adhered to the positive list criteria for clean cooking projects, as outlined in the Applicability of Methodology section. The distribution of energy-efficient cookstoves aligns with the approved activities that contribute to sustainable development goals and emission reductions.\n\nThe additionality analysis conducted for the ReNew Sakhi project has been thoroughly documented with all relevant data, parameters, and data sources provided to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results.

By focusing solely on monitoring and measurement procedures, these deviations are isolated from other aspects of the methodology, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the emission quantification process.\n\nEvidence supporting the appropriateness of these deviations includes validation studies and pilot projects that demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of remote sensing technology in monitoring stove usage and emissions. These studies indicate that the deviation in monitoring methodology does not negatively impact the conservativeness of GHG emission quantification and, in fact, enhances the precision and reliability of the data collected.\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology deviations applied in the monitoring and measurement procedures of the ReNew Sakhi project have been carefully justified and validated to ensure that they do not compromise the accuracy or conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals.
