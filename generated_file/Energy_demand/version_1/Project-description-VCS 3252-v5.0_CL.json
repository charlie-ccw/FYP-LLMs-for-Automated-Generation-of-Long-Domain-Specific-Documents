Data Monitoring and Analysis Process**\n\nThe process for obtaining, recording, compiling, and analyzing the monitored data and parameters set out in Section 5.2 (Data and Parameters Monitored) is crucial for the effective implementation of the Global Cookstove Program (Phase 24) by EKI Energy Services Limited. This section outlines the methods, organizational structure, procedures, and sampling approaches used in the monitoring activities.\n\n**6.1 Methods for Data Monitoring**\n\nThe methods for measuring, recording, storing, aggregating, collating, and reporting on monitored data and parameters will be standardized across all project locations. Monitoring equipment will be calibrated regularly following established procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability in data collection. Data will be recorded in a centralized database using digital tools to facilitate real-time monitoring and reporting.\n\n**6.2 Organizational Structure and Personnel Responsibilities**\n\nThe organizational structure for monitoring activities will include designated personnel with defined responsibilities and competencies. Monitoring technicians will be responsible for on-site data collection, while data analysts will compile and analyze the data. Quality assurance officers will oversee the monitoring process to ensure compliance with established protocols.\n\n**6.3 Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures**\n\nInternal auditing and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures will be implemented to verify the accuracy and reliability of the monitored data. Regular audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the monitoring process and identify areas for improvement. QA/QC procedures will include checks on data integrity, calibration of equipment, and adherence to monitoring protocols.\n\n**6.4 Handling Non-Conformances**\n\nProcedures for handling non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan will be established to address any deviations from the set monitoring protocols. Non-conformances will be documented, investigated, and corrective actions will be taken to ensure data integrity and reliability. Lessons learned from non-conformances will be used to improve the monitoring process.\n\n**6.5 Sampling Approaches**\n\nSampling approaches will be used to ensure representative data collection. Target precision levels, sample sizes, sample site locations, stratification criteria, and frequency of measurements will be determined based on statistical considerations and project requirements. QA/QC procedures will be integrated into the sampling process to validate the accuracy of the collected data.\n\n**6.6 GHG Data Collection and Management System**\n\nA line diagram illustrating the GHG data collection and management system will be developed to provide a visual representation of the monitoring process. The diagram will outline the flow of data from measurement to analysis, highlighting key steps, personnel involved, and quality control checkpoints.\n\nBy implementing robust data monitoring and analysis processes, EKI Energy Services Limited will ensure the reliability and accuracy of the monitored data, enabling informed decision-making and effective management of the Global Cookstove Program (Phase 24) in India."
