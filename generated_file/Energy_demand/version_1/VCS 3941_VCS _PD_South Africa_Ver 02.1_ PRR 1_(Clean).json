These deviations were necessary to ensure more accurate and reliable data collection without compromising the conservativeness of quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals.\n\nOne of the key deviations applied is the use of remote sensing technology for monitoring the actual usage of the high-efficiency cookstoves in households. Instead of relying solely on self-reported data or periodic field visits, remote sensing technology, such as satellite imagery and sensors installed on the cookstoves, is utilized to track the frequency and duration of stove usage. This deviation allows for real-time monitoring of stove usage patterns, ensuring more precise data collection on the actual reduction in wood consumption and associated GHG emissions.\n\nThe justification for this deviation lies in its ability to provide more accurate and continuous monitoring of the intervention's impact on GHG emissions. By using remote sensing technology, the data collected is less prone to human error or bias, enhancing the reliability of the quantification of emission reductions. This approach also offers a more cost-effective and scalable solution for monitoring a large number of households spread across diverse geographical areas.\n\nIt is important to note that this deviation solely pertains to the monitoring and measurement procedures of the methodology and does not impact any other aspect of the intervention. The core principles and activities related to the distribution of high-efficiency cookstoves remain unchanged, ensuring that the overall objectives of improving fuel efficiency, reducing GHG emissions, and enhancing public health and environmental sustainability are not compromised.\n\nIn conclusion, the methodology deviations applied, specifically the use of remote sensing technology for monitoring stove usage, are justified by their ability to enhance the accuracy and reliability of data collection without negatively impacting the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions.

This can be based on surveys, fuel consumption data, or historical records.\n\nb. Calculate the baseline emissions: The baseline emissions can be calculated using the following equation:\nBaseline Emissions = Baseline Fuel Consumption x Emission Factor\n\nThe emission factor represents the amount of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4) released per unit of fuel burned. It is crucial to select appropriate emission factors based on the type of biomass fuel used and the combustion technology.\n\n2. Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes:\nCarbon stock changes refer to the net change in carbon stored in biomass due to the implementation of the project. When carbon stock increases (sinks) exceed baseline emissions, baseline emissions may be negative. The calculation of carbon stock changes involves the following steps:\n\na. Estimate the carbon stock in biomass: This includes determining the initial carbon stock in the biomass resources impacted by the project, such as trees or vegetation.\n\nb. Calculate the carbon stock changes: The carbon stock changes can be calculated using the following equation:\nCarbon Stock Changes = Final Carbon Stock - Initial Carbon Stock\n\nThe final carbon stock is influenced by factors such as tree growth rates, deforestation rates, and land-use changes resulting from the project.\n\n3. Reductions and Removals Calculation:\nIf the chosen methodology provides separate procedures and equations for quantifying emission reductions and carbon removals, these should be calculated separately. The equations provided by the methodology should be followed accurately to ensure consistency and accuracy in the calculations.\n\n4.
