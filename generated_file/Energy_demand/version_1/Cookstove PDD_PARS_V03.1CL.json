In accordance with the applied methodology, the baseline scenario is identified and justified through a step-by-step process.\n\n1. Procedure Application:\nThe first step in establishing the baseline scenario is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current cooking practices in Madagascar, focusing on the types of stoves used, fuel sources, and associated emissions. This step involves gathering data on the prevalence of traditional cookstoves, the amount of biomass fuel consumed, and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Outcome of Step 1:\nThe outcome of this step reveals that the majority of households in Madagascar rely on traditional cookstoves that are inefficient and contribute significantly to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. The baseline scenario is thus characterized by high levels of biomass consumption, deforestation, and emissions.\n\n3. Methodological Choices and Rationale:\nThe decision to distribute 100,000 fuel-efficient Tsinjoharena cookstoves is based on the rationale that these stoves have been proven to significantly reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and deforestation compared to traditional stoves. The choice of this specific intervention is supported by research indicating its effectiveness in improving cooking efficiency and environmental sustainability.\n\n4. Key Assumptions and Justifications:\nKey assumptions underlying the baseline scenario include the assumption that the distribution of fuel-efficient cookstoves will lead to a widespread adoption among households in Madagascar. This assumption is justified by the success of similar initiatives in other regions and the demonstrated benefits of using improved cookstoves.\n\nIn conclusion, the baseline scenario for the distribution of 100,000 fuel-efficient Tsinjoharena cookstoves in Madagascar is established through a systematic process that considers current cooking practices, emissions levels, and the potential impact of the intervention. The methodological choices, key assumptions, and rationale for this scenario are grounded in research and supported by the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and improving cooking efficiency in Madagascar.\n\nReferences:\n- Smith, K.

The activities of the project are mandated by laws, statutes, or regulatory frameworks within Madagascar. However, it is noted that these regulations are not systematically enforced. \n\nEvidence of systematic non-enforcement of the regulatory frameworks can be observed through reports indicating gaps in implementation, lack of resources for monitoring and enforcement, and inconsistencies in compliance across regions. This lack of systematic enforcement highlights the regulatory surplus aspect of the project, where the project activities go beyond what is required by the existing regulations due to the limited enforcement mechanisms in place.\n\n**2. Additionality Methods**\n\nIn demonstrating additionality for the project, the methodology applies a combination of investment analysis and barrier analysis through the CDM Tool. The following steps were taken to assess additionality:\n\n- **Investment Analysis:** The investment analysis was conducted to evaluate the financial viability of the project and assess whether the project activities would have proceeded without the support of the carbon credits. The outcome of this analysis indicated that the project required additional financial support to be implemented, thus demonstrating additionality.\n\n- **Barrier Analysis:** The barrier analysis focused on identifying and justifying the most relevant barriers that would hinder the implementation of the project without the financial incentives from carbon credits. Key barriers such as lack of access to finance for clean cooking solutions, limited awareness about the benefits of fuel-efficient cookstoves, and challenges in distribution networks were identified and supported with relevant facts and assumptions.\n\n- **Performance Method:** The project also applied a performance method to ensure that the project can achieve a level of performance equivalent to the performance benchmark metric. By setting clear performance targets and monitoring mechanisms, the project aims to maintain and improve the efficiency of the distributed cookstoves over time.\n\n- **Activity Method:** The methodology ensures conformance with the positive list by demonstrating the applicability of the project activities in the given context of Madagascar and the benefits they bring to the environment and local communities.\n\nAll relevant data, parameters, and sources used in the additionality analysis have been provided to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results, allowing stakeholders to verify the credibility of the demonstrated additionality of the project."

In the case of the distribution of 100,000 fuel-efficient Tsinjoharena cookstoves in Madagascar to reduce deforestation and GHG emissions, it is important to address any deviations from the standard methodology.\n\nOne such deviation that may be applied in this project is related to the criteria and procedures for monitoring or measurement of the emission reductions. For example, the standard methodology may require monthly monitoring of stove usage and fuel consumption to calculate the GHG emission reductions. However, due to logistical constraints or limited resources in the project area, it may not be feasible to conduct monthly monitoring.\n\nIn such cases, a deviation to conduct monitoring on a quarterly basis instead of monthly may be justified. This deviation would not negatively impact the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions as long as the quarterly monitoring is still representative of the overall stove usage and fuel consumption patterns. By ensuring that the quarterly monitoring captures sufficient data points and variability, the deviation can be considered acceptable.\n\nIt is crucial to provide evidence to support this deviation, such as a detailed explanation of the monitoring plan, data collection methods, and analysis procedures. Additionally, validation from experts in the field of emissions quantification or project stakeholders can further strengthen the justification for the deviation.\n\nOverall, the deviation in monitoring frequency in this project is specific to the monitoring and measurement criteria and does not affect other parts of the methodology. By ensuring that the deviation is carefully considered, justified, and supported by evidence, the conservativeness of quantifying GHG emission reductions or removals can be maintained while addressing practical challenges in the project implementation."

Regular reports will be generated to provide insights into the performance and impact of the cookstove distribution program.\n\n**6.2 Organizational Structure and Responsibilities**\n\nThe personnel responsible for carrying out monitoring activities will be organized into a dedicated team with clear responsibilities and competencies. This team will include monitoring specialists, data analysts, and quality assurance officers. Each member will have specific roles in data collection, analysis, and reporting to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the monitored data.\n\n**6.3 Internal Auditing and QA/QC Procedures**\n\nInternal auditing and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures will be implemented to ensure the reliability and validity of the monitored data. Regular audits will be conducted to verify the accuracy of the data collection process and adherence to monitoring protocols. QA/QC procedures will be in place to identify and address any discrepancies or errors in the data.\n\n**6.4 Handling Non-Conformances**\n\nProcedures for handling non-conformances with the validated monitoring plan will be established to address any deviations from the set monitoring protocols. Any non-conformances will be documented, investigated, and corrective actions will be taken to rectify the issues. This ensures that the data collected remains accurate and reliable for analysis.\n\n**6.5 Sampling Approaches**\n\nSampling approaches will be used to determine the target precision levels, sample sizes, sample site locations, stratification, and frequency of measurement. QA/QC procedures will be integrated into the sampling process to ensure the quality of the samples collected. The sampling approach will be designed to provide a representative sample of the data for analysis.\n\n**6.6 GHG Data Collection and Management System**\n\nA line diagram displaying the GHG data collection and management system will be developed to provide a visual representation of how the data is collected, stored, and analyzed. This diagram will illustrate the flow of data from monitoring equipment to the centralized database system, highlighting key steps in the data management process.\n\nBy following these processes and procedures, we aim to effectively monitor and analyze the data and parameters related to the distribution of fuel-efficient Tsinjoharena cookstoves, ensuring the success of the program in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation in Madagascar."
