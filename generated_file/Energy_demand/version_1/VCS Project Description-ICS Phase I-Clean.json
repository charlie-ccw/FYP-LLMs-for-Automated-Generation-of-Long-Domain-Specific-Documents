Quantification of Estimated GHG Emission Reductions and Carbon Dioxide Removals**\n\nIn this section, we will outline the procedure for quantifying the estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals resulting from the distribution of fuel-efficient Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) to rural households in the Sabarkantha and Patan districts of Gujarat, India. The calculations will be based on the estimated data and parameter values provided in Section 5.2.\n\n### 6.1. Procedure for Quantification\n\n#### 6.1.1. Emission Reductions Calculation\n\nThe estimated baseline emissions, project emissions, and leakage emissions will be used to calculate the estimated reduction Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) for projects that do not require assessing permanence risk. The equations used for this calculation are as follows:\n\n1. **Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) = Estimated Baseline Emissions - Estimated Project Emissions - Estimated Leakage Emissions**\n\nTo enable reproducibility, we will provide the calculations for each vintage period in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet as shown in Table 1 below:\n\n| Vintage Period | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000 | Example: 20,000 | Example: 10,000 | Example: 10,000 | Example: 10,000 | Example: 20,000 |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                  |                                    |                                   |                                  |                                 |                               |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                  |                                    |                                   |                                  |                                 |                               |\n| Total                                                 |                                  |                                    |                                   |                                  |                                 |                               |\n\n#### 6.1.2. Carbon Dioxide Removals Calculation\n\nFor projects requiring an assessment of permanence risk, the calculation of estimated reduction and removal VCUs will consider the buffer pool allocation. The equations for calculating the estimated reduction and removal VCUs are as follows:\n\n1. **Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) = (1 - Buffer Pool Allocation) * (Estimated Baseline Emissions - Estimated Project Emissions - Estimated Leakage Emissions)**\n2. **Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) = Buffer Pool Allocation * (Estimated Baseline Emissions - Estimated Project Emissions - Estimated Leakage Emissions)**\n\nThese calculations will be documented in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet as shown in Table 2 below:\n\n| Vintage Period | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000 | Example: 20,000 | Example: 10,000 | Example: 4,000 | Example: 8,000 | Example: 8,000 | Example: 16,000 |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                  |                                    |                                   |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                         |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                  |                                    |                                   |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                         |\n| Total                                                 |                                  |                                    |                                   |                                          |                                  |                                 |                                         |\n\n### 6.2.
