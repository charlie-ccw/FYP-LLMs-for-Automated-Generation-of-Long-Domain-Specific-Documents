The primary equation used for this calculation is:\n\n\\[ ER_{y,i,j} = B_{y,saving,i,j} \\times fNRB_y \\times NCV_{wood fuel} \\times (EF_{wf,CO2} + EF_{wf,non CO2}) \\times N_{y,i,j} \\times 0.95 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( B_{y,saving,i,j} \\) is the quantity of woody biomass saved per improved cook stove of type i and batch j during year y.\n- \\( fNRB_y \\) is the fraction of woody biomass that is non-renewable (default value: 0.89).\n- \\( NCV_{wood fuel} \\) is the net calorific value of the wood fuel.\n- \\( EF_{wf,CO2} \\) is the emission factor of CO2 from wood fuel.\n- \\( EF_{wf,non CO2} \\) is the emission factor of non-CO2 gases from wood fuel.\n- \\( N_{y,i,j} \\) is the number of improved cook stoves of type i and batch j in use during year y.\n\n### Carbon Dioxide Removals\n\nCarbon dioxide removals are calculated similarly, focusing on the reduction in the amount of non-renewable resources used. The efficiency of improved cookstoves is estimated ex-ante, and the loss in efficiency per year is calculated.\n\n### Application of Equations\n\nTo apply the equations accurately, each variable must be clearly defined and measured or estimated as follows:\n\n1. **Biomass Savings**:\n   \\[\n   B_{y,saving,i,j} = B_{old} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\eta_{old}}{\\eta_{new,i,j}} - 1 \\right)\n   \\]\n   - \\( B_{old} \\) is the biomass used by old stoves.\n   - \\( \\eta_{old} \\) is the efficiency of old stoves (default value: 0.1).\n   - \\( \\eta_{new,i,j} \\) is the efficiency of new stoves of type i and batch j.\n\n2. **Emission Factors**:\n   - \\( EF_{wf,CO2} \\) and \\( EF_{wf,non CO2} \\) are derived from standard emission factors for wood fuel combustion.\n\n3. **Net Calorific Value**:\n   - \\( NCV_{wood fuel} \\) is obtained from fuel-specific calorific values.\n\n### Data and Parameters Monitored\n\nThe data and parameters used in the calculations are monitored and documented to ensure accuracy. The estimated values provided in Section 5.2 are used to populate the equations.\n\n### Annual Calculations for Estimated Reductions or Removals\n\nThe following are the annual calculations for estimated reductions or removals, allowing for reproduction of the results:\n\n- **Year 1**: 82,622 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 2**: 228,900 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 3**: 274,152 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 4**: 237,903 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 5**: 202,759 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 6**: 213,338 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 7**: 266,885 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 8**: 274,152 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 9**: 110,029 tonnes of CO2e\n- **Year 10**: 202,759 tonnes of CO2e\n\n### Tables for Vintage Periods\n\n#### For Projects Not Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n| Vintage period           | Estimated baseline emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated project emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated leakage emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000                     | Example: 20,000                    | Example: 10,000                   | Example: 10,000                | Example: 10,000              | Example: 20,000             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                 |                               |                             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                 |                               |                             |\n| **Total**                 |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                 |                               |                             |\n\n#### For Projects Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n##### Non-Permanence Risk Assessment\n\n- **Non-permanence risk rating (%):** Example: 20%\n- **Has the non-permanence risk report been attached?** \u2610 Yes \u2610 No\n- **For ARR and IFM projects with harvesting, state the Long-term Average (LTA) in tCO2e.**\n- **Has the LTA been updated based on monitored data, if applicable?** \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n- **State the expected total GHG benefit to date in tCO2e.**\n- **Is the number of GHG credits issued below the LTA?** \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n\n##### Table for Project Crediting Period\n\n| Vintage period           | Estimated baseline emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated project emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated leakage emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated buffer pool allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated total VCU issuance (tCO2e) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY | Example: 50,000                     | Example: 20,000                    | Example: 10,000                   | Example: 4,000                         | Example: 8,000                  | Example: 8,000                 | Example: 16,000                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                         |                                 |                               |                                     |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                         |                                 |                               |                                     |\n| **Total**                 |                                      |                                     |                                    |                                         |                                 |                               |                                     |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive procedure for the quantification of GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals, including detailed equations and monitored data parameters.
