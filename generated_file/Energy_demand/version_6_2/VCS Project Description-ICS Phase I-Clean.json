        "section_name": "Baseline Scenario",
        "generation": "## Baseline Scenario\n\n### Introduction\nThe baseline scenario is a critical component in assessing the impact of the project activity. It represents the situation that would prevail in the absence of the project. For this project, the baseline scenario is identified as the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel (firewood/charcoal) or fossil fuel by the target population to meet similar thermal energy needs as provided by the project cook stoves. This section outlines the procedure followed to identify and justify the baseline scenario, including the key assumptions, rationale, and methodological choices.\n\n### Procedure for Identifying the Baseline Scenario\nThe procedure to identify the baseline scenario is based on the guidelines provided in the latest version of the CDM document \"Sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities.\" The steps involved are as follows:\n\n1. **Determine the Default Scenario**: Identify what the target population would continue to use in the absence of the project activity. This involves understanding their current energy consumption patterns and sources.\n\n2. **Conduct a Baseline Survey**: Utilize a sampling approach described in the CDM document or opt for a simple random sampling method. The minimum sample size is determined according to specific guidelines to ensure statistical significance.\n\n3. **Identify the Baseline Scenario**: Based on the survey results, confirm that the baseline scenario is the continued use of non-renewable firewood by the target population.\n\n### Application of Procedure Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Determining the Default Scenario\nIn the absence of the project activity, the target population, primarily the rural tribal communities in the Sabarkantha and Patan Districts of Gujarat, would continue to rely on non-renewable firewood or fossil fuels to meet their thermal energy needs. This assumption is based on historical data and current practices observed in these regions.\n\n#### Step 2: Conducting the Baseline Survey\nA comprehensive baseline survey was conducted using a simple random sampling approach. The sample size was determined following the guidelines provided in the CDM document to ensure that the data collected would be representative of the entire population. The survey focused on understanding the types of fuel currently used, the quantity consumed, and the frequency of use.\n\n#### Step 3: Identifying the Baseline Scenario\nThe survey results confirmed that the predominant source of thermal energy in the target population is non-renewable firewood. This finding aligns with historical usage patterns and the lack of access to alternative energy sources in the region. Thus, the baseline scenario is identified as the continued use of non-renewable firewood.\n\n### Justification of Key Assumptions\n\n#### Continued Use of Non-Renewable Firewood\nThe key assumption is that, in the absence of the project activity, the target population would continue to use non-renewable firewood or fossil fuels to meet their energy needs. This is justified by the following:\n- **Historical Data**: Historical data indicates a long-standing reliance on firewood for cooking and heating purposes.\n- **Economic Constraints**: The economic condition of the rural tribal population limits their ability to switch to more expensive, alternative energy sources.\n- **Lack of Alternatives**: There is a lack of accessible and affordable renewable energy alternatives in the region.\n\n### Rationale for Methodological Choices\nThe methodological choice to use a simple random sampling approach and to determine the baseline scenario based on the continued use of non-renewable firewood is rationalized as follows:\n- **Representativeness**: Simple random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the entire population, providing reliable data.\n- **Relevance**: The reliance on non-renewable firewood is highly relevant to the target population, making it a realistic baseline scenario.\n- **Alignment with Methodology**: This approach aligns with the approved methodology VMR0006 version 1.1, which recognizes the continued use of non-renewable firewood as a baseline scenario for similar projects.\n\n### Relevant References\n- **Approved Methodology VMR0006 Version 1.1**: Paragraph 6 of this methodology supports the identification of the baseline scenario as the continued use of non-renewable firewood or fossil fuels by the target population.\n- **CDM Document \"Sampling and Surveys for CDM Project Activities and Programme of Activities\"**: This document provides the guidelines for conducting the baseline survey and determining the sample size.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe baseline scenario for this project is the continued use of non-renewable wood fuel (firewood/charcoal) or fossil fuel by the target population. This scenario has been identified and justified through a structured procedure involving a baseline survey, key assumptions, and methodological choices aligned with approved methodologies and guidelines. By clearly documenting each step and providing relevant references, the baseline scenario is robustly established, laying the foundation for assessing the impact of the project activity."

This section outlines the procedure for quantifying leakage emissions in accordance with the applied methodology, detailing the reduction and removal calculations separately, and providing all relevant equations and methodological choices.\n\n### Quantification of Leakage Emissions\nThe applied methodology specifies a default factor to account for leakage emissions. The leakage emissions are quantified by applying a default factor of 0.95 to the total emission reductions achieved by the project. This factor accounts for potential emissions that occur due to the displacement of activities or resources outside the project boundary.\n\n#### Relevant Equations\nThe following equations from the VCS methodology are used to quantify leakage emissions:\n\n**Equation 1: Total Emission Reductions (ER)**\n\\[ ER = BE - PE \\]\nWhere:\n- \\( ER \\) = Total Emission Reductions\n- \\( BE \\) = Baseline Emissions\n- \\( PE \\) = Project Emissions\n\n**Equation 2: Leakage Emissions (LE)**\n\\[ LE = ER \\times (1 - 0.95) \\]\nWhere:\n- \\( LE \\) = Leakage Emissions\n- \\( ER \\) = Total Emission Reductions\n\n### Reductions and Removals Specification\nThe applied methodology specifies that reductions and removals should be calculated separately. Baseline emissions are not accounted for separately; instead, the net emission reductions achieved by the project are quantified. The net emission reductions are calculated by subtracting the project emissions from the baseline emissions.\n\n### Methodological Choices\nThe selection of emission factors and default values is critical in ensuring accuracy in the quantification of leakage emissions. The following methodological choices are made based on the approved methodology VMR0006:\n\n1. **Non-CO2 Emission Factor (EFwf,non CO2)**:\n   - This factor represents the non-CO2 emissions from the use of wood fuel in the baseline scenario.\n   - Default values are sourced from the methodology and are justified based on regional studies and empirical data.\n\n2. **CO2 Emission Factor (EFwf,CO2)**:\n   - This factor represents the CO2 emissions from the use of wood fuel in the baseline scenario.\n   - Default values are provided in the methodology and are based on standardized emission factors for wood fuel combustion.\n\n3. **Efficiency of the Baseline Cookstove (\u03b7old)**:\n   - This value represents the efficiency of the cookstove used in the baseline scenario.\n   - Default values are used as per the approved methodology, which are derived from field studies and manufacturer specifications.\n\n### Justification of Methodological Choices\nThe choice of emission factors and default values is justified based on the following:\n- **Non-CO2 and CO2 Emission Factors**: The default values are selected from the approved methodology VMR0006, which provides standardized emission factors based on extensive research and empirical data. These values ensure consistency and reliability in the calculations.\n- **Efficiency of the Baseline Cookstove**: The efficiency value is sourced from the methodology, reflecting typical efficiencies observed in the region. This ensures that the baseline scenario is accurately represented.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\nAll calculations related to emission reductions and removals, including the quantification of leakage emissions, are included in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This spreadsheet provides a transparent and reproducible record of all calculations, ensuring that the quantification process can be independently verified.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe procedure for quantifying leakage emissions involves the application of a default factor to account for potential emissions outside the project boundary. By following the specified methodology and using the relevant equations, the quantification process ensures the accuracy and integrity of the reported net emission reductions. All methodological choices are justified based on the approved methodology, providing a robust framework for the calculation of leakage emissions."

Detailed descriptions and applications of these equations can be found in Section 4.4 of the project document.\n\n### Key Equations for Annual Calculations\n\nThe key equations for annual calculations of estimated GHG emission reductions or removals are:\n\n- **Equation 1**: For calculating emission reductions, accounting for different types/models of improved cookstoves and their batches.\n- **Equation 2**: For calculating carbon dioxide removals.\n\n### Specifying Reductions and Removals Separately\n\nThe methodology provides specific procedures and equations to quantify GHG emission reductions and removals separately. For example:\n\n- **Equation 1**: Calculates emission reductions during a specific year, considering different types/models of improved cookstoves and different batches of these cookstoves.\n\n### Tables for Crediting Period\n\n#### For Projects Not Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\nComplete the table below for the project crediting period:\n\n| Vintage Period            | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| DD-MMM-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY| Example: 50,000                      | Example: 20,000                     | Example: 10,000                     | Example: 10,000                 | Example: 10,000               | Example: 20,000             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to 31-Dec-YYYY|                                      |                                     |                                     |                                 |                                |                             |\n| 01-Jan-YYYY to DD-MMM-YYYY|                                      |                                     |                                     |                                 |                                |                             |\n| Total                     |                                      |                                     |                                     |                                 |                                |                             |\n\n#### For Projects Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\ni) Provide the requested information using the table below:\n\n- **Non-permanence Risk Rating (%)**: Example: 20%\n- **Has the non-permanence risk report been attached as either an appendix or a separate document?**: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No\n- **For ARR and IFM projects with harvesting, state, in tCO2e, the Long-term Average (LTA)**: \n- **Has the LTA been updated based on monitored data, if applicable?**: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n- **State, in tCO2e, the expected total GHG benefit to date**:\n- **Is the number of GHG credits issued below the LTA?**: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n\nii) Complete the table below for the project crediting period.
