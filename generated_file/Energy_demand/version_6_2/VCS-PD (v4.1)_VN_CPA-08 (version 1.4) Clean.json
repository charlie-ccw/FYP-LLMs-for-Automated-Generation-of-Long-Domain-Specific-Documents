This method primarily relied on firewood as the fuel source. This scenario, characterized by the widespread use of inefficient and polluting open fires, represents the baseline situation for Improved Cookstove (ICS) users in the absence of the project activity.\n\n### Assurance Against GHG Emission Generation for Reduction Purposes\n\nThe project has been meticulously designed to align with the actual baseline scenario, which is the common practice of using three-stone open fires for cooking. In the absence of this project, thermal energy would continue to be generated using firewood in these traditional open fires. It is crucial to emphasize that the project has not been initiated with the intent to generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction. \n\nTo further substantiate this, the project is registered under a Clean Development Mechanism Program of Activities (CDM-PoA). This registration ensures that any GHG emission reductions and removals are not utilized for compliance under any other programs or mechanisms except CDM. This adherence to CDM guidelines provides a robust framework that prevents the generation of emissions merely for the purpose of claiming reductions.\n\n### Baseline Scenario\n\nThe baseline scenario is identical to the conditions that existed prior to the initiation of the project. The existing scenario before the project's implementation is referred to as the actual baseline scenario. Consequently, there is no need to repeat the description of the scenarios here. For a comprehensive understanding of the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach ensures clarity and conciseness, offering a clear depiction of the pre-project conditions while affirming the project's integrity in terms of GHG emission management."

This involves understanding the common practices of ICS users, which in this case, is the use of three-stone open fires for cooking.\n   \n2. **Documentation of Common Practice**: The next step is to document the common practice in detail. For this project, the common practice is the use of firewood in three-stone open fires to generate thermal energy for cooking.\n\n3. **Assessment of Thermal Energy Generation**: The procedure then involves assessing how thermal energy would be generated in the absence of the project. This helps in establishing the baseline scenario, which is the use of firewood in three-stone open fires.\n\n4. **Application of Default Adjustment Factors**: A default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to account for leakage, as per the methodology. This eliminates the need for separate surveys or leakage management.\n\n### Key Assumptions\nThe following key assumptions are made in the baseline scenario:\n\n- The baseline scenario is based on the common practice of using three-stone open fires for cooking.\n- The methodology applied is CDM Methodology AMS-II.G. 'Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass', Version 11.0.\n- A default net to gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is used to account for leakage.\n\n### Rationale Behind Key Assumptions\nThe rationale for the key assumptions is grounded in the actual practices observed among ICS users. Without the project, the generation of thermal energy would continue to rely on firewood burned in three-stone open fires. This common practice provides a reliable basis for estimating the annual average and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions that the project aims to achieve.\n\n### Methodological Choices\nThe choice of methodology, CDM Methodology AMS-II.G., is driven by its relevance and applicability to the project's context. The methodology provides a robust framework for assessing energy efficiency measures in thermal applications of non-renewable biomass. The default adjustment factor of 0.95 is a methodological choice that simplifies the process by accounting for leakage without the need for additional surveys.\n\n### Relevant References\nThe baseline scenario and the applied methodology are supported by several key references:\n\n- The project activity is registered under the CDM-PoA 10477, a CDM registered GHG program.\n- Section 3.20.5 of the VCS Standard V4.3 provides additional guidelines and standards.\n- Detailed information can be found in Section B of the registered PoA-DD.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the baseline scenario for this project is the use of firewood in three-stone open fires by ICS users to meet cooking energy demands. The identification and justification of this baseline scenario follow a structured procedure, incorporating key assumptions and methodological choices supported by relevant references. This comprehensive approach ensures the accurate estimation of GHG emission reductions, thereby validating the project's impact."
