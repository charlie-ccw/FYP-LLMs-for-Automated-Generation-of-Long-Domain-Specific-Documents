In this context, the baseline scenario is identified as the use of firewood in three-stone open fires to generate thermal energy for cooking purposes. This method reflects the common practice in the region and serves as the reference point against which the project's impact on energy efficiency and emission reductions will be measured.\n\n#### Procedure for Identifying the Baseline Scenario\nThe identification of the baseline scenario follows a structured procedure as outlined in the applied methodology AMS-II.G Version 09.0. This methodology is specifically designed for small-scale projects focusing on energy efficiency in thermal applications. The steps involved in this procedure are as follows:\n\n1. **Assessment of Pre-Project Conditions**: The initial step involves a comprehensive assessment of the existing cooking practices in the region. This includes understanding the prevalent use of firewood and three-stone open fires for cooking.\n\n2. **Establishment of Common Practice**: The next step is to establish that the use of firewood in three-stone open fires is the common practice in the region. This involves collecting data and evidence to demonstrate that this method is widely used and accepted.\n\n3. **Documentation and Validation**: The final step is to document the findings and validate them through relevant references and data sources. This ensures that the identified baseline scenario is accurate and can be used as a benchmark for the project's outcomes.\n\n#### Key Assumptions and Rationale\nSeveral key assumptions underpin the identification of the baseline scenario:\n\n- **Methodological Framework**: The project applies the AMS-II.G Version 09.0 methodology, which is tailored for small-scale energy efficiency projects. This methodology provides a robust framework for identifying and validating the baseline scenario.\n  \n- **Project Classification**: The project qualifies as a Type II small-scale CPA (Clean Development Mechanism Programme of Activities), focusing on the distribution of energy-efficient cook stoves.\n\n- **Common Practice**: The baseline scenario assumes that, in the absence of the project, the common practice of using firewood in three-stone open fires would continue to meet the cooking energy demand.\n\nThe rationale behind these assumptions and methodological choices is grounded in the objectives of the Poverty Reduction Strategy under the Policy Framework and the commitments outlined in the Madagascar Action Plan 2007-2011 (MAP). These commitments include promoting local cook stove programs, creating local jobs, and enhancing business opportunities through local manufacturing and distribution of cook stoves.\n\n#### Methodological Choices\nThe methodological choices made in this project align with the goals of improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. These choices include:\n\n- **Adoption of AMS-II.G Methodology**: This methodology is specifically designed for small-scale projects and provides a structured approach to identifying and validating the baseline scenario.\n  \n- **Focus on Energy Efficiency**: The project aims to distribute energy-efficient cook stoves, which fall under the category of efficiency improvements in thermal applications. This focus aligns with the broader objectives of reducing firewood consumption and emissions.\n\n- **Local Economic Benefits**: By promoting local manufacturing and distribution of cook stoves, the project supports income generation, job improvement, and vocational training, which are key components of the Madagascar Action Plan.\n\n#### References\n- AMS-II.G Version 09.0: Small-scale methodology for energy efficiency in thermal applications.\n- Madagascar Action Plan 2007-2011 (MAP): Policy framework outlining commitments to poverty reduction and sustainable development.\n- Relevant data and evidence supporting the common practice of using firewood in three-stone open fires for cooking in the region.\n\nBy following this structured procedure and making informed methodological choices, the baseline scenario is accurately identified and justified, providing a solid foundation for measuring the project's impact on energy efficiency and emission reductions."

This section outlines the procedure for quantifying leakage emissions in accordance with the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G. \"Energy Efficiency Measures in Thermal Applications of Non-Renewable Biomass\", Version 09.0. The methodology prescribes the use of a default net-to-gross adjustment factor to account for leakage, thus simplifying the process and ensuring consistency.\n\n### Quantification Procedure\n\n#### Default Net-to-Gross Adjustment Factor\nAccording to the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G, a default net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95 is applied to account for leakage emissions. This factor is used universally within this methodology, eliminating the need for additional surveys or separate leakage management activities. \n\n**Equation for Leakage Emissions:**\n\n\\[ \\text{LE} = \\text{ER} \\times (1 - 0.95) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\text{LE} \\) = Leakage Emissions\n- \\( \\text{ER} \\) = Emission Reductions\n\nThis equation ensures that 5% of the emission reductions are conservatively assumed to be offset by leakage, providing a straightforward and standardized approach to quantification.\n\n### Specification of Reductions and Removals\nThe methodology does not provide distinct procedures for separately specifying reductions and removals regarding leakage emissions. Instead, the application of the default net-to-gross adjustment factor inherently accounts for potential leakage, thus simplifying the process.\n\n### Reproducing the Calculations\nTo reproduce the calculations of leakage emissions, the following steps should be followed:\n\n1. **Determine Emission Reductions (ER):** Calculate the total emission reductions achieved by the project.\n2. **Apply the Default Net-to-Gross Adjustment Factor:** Use the provided equation to account for leakage emissions by applying the factor of 0.95.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n\nIf the total emission reductions (ER) are calculated to be 1000 tons of CO\u2082e:\n\n\\[ \\text{LE} = 1000 \\times (1 - 0.95) \\]\n\\[ \\text{LE} = 1000 \\times 0.05 \\]\n\\[ \\text{LE} = 50 \\text{ tons of CO\u2082e} \\]\n\nThus, the leakage emissions would be quantified as 50 tons of CO\u2082e.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\n#### Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values\nThe key methodological choice involves the adoption of the default net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95 as stipulated in paragraph 29 of the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G. This selection is justified by the methodology\u2019s comprehensive approach, which negates the need for additional surveys or separate leakage management, thereby ensuring efficiency and consistency in the quantification process.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe quantification of leakage emissions under the CDM Methodology: AMS-II.G is streamlined by the application of a default net-to-gross adjustment factor of 0.95. This approach ensures a consistent, standardized method for accounting for leakage, eliminating the need for complex surveys or separate management practices. By adhering to this methodology, projects can reliably quantify leakage emissions and maintain the integrity of their emission reduction claims.

For example:\n\n- **Baseline Emissions Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  BE = (100 \\, \\text{tons of fossil fuel used} \\times 0.074 \\, \\text{tCO2e/ton}) + (50 \\, \\text{tons of biomass burned} \\times 0.112 \\, \\text{tCO2e/ton}) = 7.4 + 5.6 = 13 \\, \\text{tCO2e}\n  \\]\n\n- **Project Emissions Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  PE = (80 \\, \\text{tons of fossil fuel used} \\times 0.074 \\, \\text{tCO2e/ton}) + (30 \\, \\text{tons of biomass burned} \\times 0.112 \\, \\text{tCO2e/ton}) = 5.92 + 3.36 = 9.28 \\, \\text{tCO2e}\n  \\]\n\n- **Leakage Emissions Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  LE = (10 \\, \\text{tons of fossil fuel used} \\times 0.074 \\, \\text{tCO2e/ton}) = 0.74 \\, \\text{tCO2e}\n  \\]\n\n- **Net GHG Emission Reductions Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  ER = 13 \\, \\text{tCO2e} - 9.28 \\, \\text{tCO2e} - 0.74 \\, \\text{tCO2e} = 3.98 \\, \\text{tCO2e}\n  \\]\n\n- **Carbon Dioxide Removals Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  CR = (100 \\, \\text{tons of CO2 sequestered} \\times 1 \\, \\text{tCO2e/ton}) = 100 \\, \\text{tCO2e}\n  \\]\n\n### Data and Parameters Monitored\n\nThe data and parameters monitored are crucial for the accuracy of the calculations. These include activity data (AD), emission factors (EF), and removal factors (RF). The estimated values provided in Section 5.2 are used to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\n### Calculation Tables by Vintage Period\n\n#### For Projects Not Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n| Vintage Period | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCUs (tCO2e) |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 09-Oct-2018 to 31-Dec-2018 | 50,000 | 20,000 | 10,000 | 10,000 | 10,000 | 20,000 |\n| 01-Jan-2019 to 31-Dec-2019 | 60,000 | 25,000 | 12,000 | 15,000 | 8,000 | 23,000 |\n| 01-Jan-2020 to 31-Dec-2020 | 55,000 | 22,000 | 11,000 | 14,000 | 8,000 | 22,000 |\n| Total | 165,000 | 67,000 | 33,000 | 39,000 | 26,000 | 65,000 |\n\n#### For Projects Required to Assess Permanence Risk\n\n| Vintage Period | Estimated Baseline Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Project Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Leakage Emissions (tCO2e) | Estimated Buffer Pool Allocation (tCO2e) | Estimated Reduction VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Removal VCUs (tCO2e) | Estimated Total VCU Issuance (tCO2e) |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 09-Oct-2018 to 31-Dec-2018 | 50,000 | 20,000 | 10,000 | 4,000 | 8,000 | 8,000 | 16,000 |\n| 01-Jan-2019 to 31-Dec-2019 | 60,000 | 25,000 | 12,000 | 5,000 | 13,000 | 7,000 | 20,000 |\n| 01-Jan-2020 to 31-Dec-2020 | 55,000 | 22,000 | 11,000 | 4,500 | 12,000 | 7,500 | 19,500 |\n| Total | 165,000 | 67,000 | 33,000 | 13,500 | 33,000 | 22,500 | 55,500 |\n\n### Permanence Risk Assessment\n\nFor projects required to assess permanence risk, the following information is provided:\n\n- **Non-Permanence Risk Rating**: 20%\n- **Non-Permanence Risk Report Attached**: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No\n- **Long-term Average (LTA)**: [Specify in tCO2e]\n- **LTA Updated Based on Monitored Data**: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n- **Expected Total GHG Benefit to Date**: [Specify in tCO2e]\n- **Number of GHG Credits Issued Below the LTA**: \u2610 Yes \u2610 No (If no, provide justification)\n\nThis comprehensive documentation ensures that the procedure for quantification of estimated GHG emission reductions and carbon dioxide removals is transparent, reproducible, and aligned with the required standards."
