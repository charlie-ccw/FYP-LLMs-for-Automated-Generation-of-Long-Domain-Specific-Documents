        "generation": "## Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\n\n### Existing Conditions\n\nBefore the initiation of the project, the following conditions were prevalent:\n\n1. **Landfill Gas Emissions:**\n   - At the Lianzhou landfill site, landfill gas (LFG), primarily composed of methane, was being emitted directly into the atmosphere. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), has a global warming potential significantly higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\n2. **Electricity Generation:**\n   - The electricity equivalent to what the project aims to generate was originally supplied by the China Southern Power Grid (CSPG). CSPG predominantly relies on fossil fuel-fired power plants, which are major sources of CO2 emissions.\n\n### Project Implementation and GHG Emissions\n\nThe project has been designed with the primary objective of reducing, removing, or destroying GHG emissions, not generating them for subsequent mitigation. The key activities involved in the project include:\n\n- **Capturing and Destroying Landfill Gas (LFG):**\n  - The project captures LFG from the landfill site and prevents its release into the atmosphere. This action significantly reduces methane emissions, thereby mitigating a major source of GHG.\n\n- **Displacing Fossil Fuel-Based Electricity:**\n  - By generating electricity from the combustion of the recovered LFG, the project displaces the need for electricity from CSPG\u2019s fossil fuel-fired power plants. This substitution results in a net reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\n- **Generating Renewable Energy:**\n  - The captured LFG is combusted to generate electricity. This renewable energy source contributes to a reduction in the dependency on fossil fuels.\n\n### Baseline Scenario\n\nThe baseline scenario, representing the conditions prior to the project initiation, remains unchanged. The pre-existing conditions are identical to the baseline scenario. For a detailed description of the baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\nIn conclusion, the project has been initiated to address and mitigate GHG emissions rather than to generate them for later reduction. The pre-project conditions involved direct emissions of LFG and reliance on fossil fuel-based electricity, which the project aims to transform through effective GHG reduction strategies."

        "generation": "## Quantification of Leakage Emissions\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Leakage Emissions\n\nThe quantification of leakage emissions follows a systematic procedure as outlined below:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Electricity Systems**: \n   - Determine which electricity systems are applicable to the project. This involves identifying all potential sources of electricity that could be impacted by the project activities.\n\n2. **Include Off-Grid Power Plants (Optional)**:\n   - Decide whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system. This step is optional but may provide a more comprehensive assessment of leakage emissions.\n\n3. **Select a Method to Determine the Operating Margin (OM)**:\n   - Choose an appropriate method for calculating the Operating Margin (OM) emission factor. The methodology provides four options, with the 'Simple OM' method often selected under specific conditions.\n\n4. **Calculate the Operating Margin Emission Factor**:\n   - Using the selected method, calculate the OM emission factor. This factor represents the emissions from the marginal power plants that are affected by the project.\n\n5. **Calculate the Build Margin (BM) Emission Factor**:\n   - Determine the Build Margin (BM) emission factor, which accounts for the emissions from new power plants that are built to meet the additional demand created by the project.\n\n6. **Calculate the Combined Margin (CM) Emission Factor**:\n   - Combine the OM and BM emission factors to obtain the Combined Margin (CM) emission factor. This factor is used to estimate the overall impact of the project on the electricity system.\n\n### Reductions and Removals\n\n#### Emission Reductions\nEmission reductions are calculated by the difference between baseline emissions and project emissions for a given year. The relevant equation is:\n\n\\[\nER_y = BE_y - PE_y\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(ER_y\\) = Emission reductions in year y (t CO2e/yr)\n- \\(BE_y\\) = Baseline emissions in year y (t CO2e/yr)\n- \\(PE_y\\) = Project emissions in year y (t CO2e/yr)\n\n#### Relevant Equations\n\n##### Baseline Emissions in Year y (t CO2e/yr)\n\n\\[\nBE_y = BE_{CH4, y} + BE_{EC, y}\n\\]\n\n##### Baseline Emissions of Methane from the SWDS in Year y (t CO2e/yr)\n\n\\[\nBE_{CH4, y} = (1 - f_{OX}) \\times (MSWDS_{j, y} \\times DOC_j \\times DOCF \\times F \\times \\frac{16}{12} - R \\times OXID)\n\\]\n\n##### Project Emissions from Electricity Consumption in Year y (t CO2/yr)\n\n\\[\nPE_{EC, y} = \\sum (QEC_{j, y} \\times EFgrid_{CM, y} \\times (1 - TDL_{j, y}))\n\\]\n\n##### Project Emissions in Year y (t CO2/yr)\n\n\\[\nPE_y = PE_{EC, y} + PE_{FC, y} + PE_{DT, y} + PE_{SP, y}\n\\]\n\n##### Baseline Emissions Associated with Electricity Generation in Year y (t CO2/yr)\n\n\\[\nBE_{EC, y} = \\sum (QEC_{k, y} \\times EFgrid_{CM, y} \\times (1 - TDL_{k, y}))\n\\]\n\n### Information for Reproducing Calculations\n\nTo ensure transparency and reproducibility, the following information is provided:\n\n1. **Methodological Tool**: Use the tool titled 'Baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation'.\n2. **Measurement Methods and Procedures**: Implement continuous measurement using a bi-directional electricity meter, monitor and archive data, and double-check with electricity sales receipts.\n3. **Calculation Method for Electricity Generated Using LFG**: Multiply the estimated annual LFG utilization (m\u00b3 CH\u2084) by 3.2 kWh/m\u00b3.\n4. **Details on Gaseous Stream and Measurement Intervals**: Provide specifics on the gaseous stream, greenhouse gases, and measurement intervals.\n5. **Project-Specific Emissions Calculations**: Include the formulas and parameters used, such as the quantity of electricity consumed, emission factor for electricity generation, and technical transmission and distribution losses.\n6. **Steps for Determining Emission Factor for Electricity Generation**: Identify relevant electricity systems, decide on the inclusion of off-grid power plants, select the OM method, and calculate OM, BM, and CM emission factors.\n\n### Methodological Choices\n\nKey methodological choices include:\n\n- **Gaseous Stream Specification**: Determine the applicable gaseous stream.\n- **Mass Flow for Specific Greenhouse Gases**: Measure the flow at specified intervals.\n- **Simplifications for Molecular Mass Calculation**: Identify situations where simplifications are not valid.\n- **Six Steps for Electricity Systems**: Identify relevant systems, decide on off-grid power plants, select OM method, and calculate OM, BM, and CM emission factors.\n- **Emission Factors for Electricity Consumption**: Use default values for project emissions.\n\n### Selection Criteria for Emission Factors and Default Values\n\n- **Data Source**: Use the latest available data, such as the 2019 China baseline emission factor.\n- **Default Values for Transmission and Distribution Losses**: 20% for project consumption sources and 3% for baseline consumption sources.\n- **Methods for Calculating OM Emission Factor**: Choose from four methods, with the 'Simple OM' method selected due to specific conditions.\n- **Ex-Ante Option for OM Calculation**: Determine the emission factor once at validation and do not recalculate during the crediting period.\n\n### Inclusion of Calculations in Spreadsheet\n\nAll calculations related to emission reductions and removals should be meticulously documented in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This includes:\n\n- Detailed breakdown of each step in the quantification process.\n- Specific equations and parameters used.\n- Justifications for methodological choices and default values.\n- Data sources and measurement methods.\n\nBy following the structured procedure and including all relevant details, the quantification of leakage emissions can be accurately and transparently reproduced."
