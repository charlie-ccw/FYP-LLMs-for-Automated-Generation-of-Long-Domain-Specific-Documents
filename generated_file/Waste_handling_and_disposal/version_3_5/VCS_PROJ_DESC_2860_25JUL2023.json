        "generation": "The proposed project activity centers on implementing advanced waste management technologies aimed at substantially reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The key measures to be executed include: \n\n- **Installation of Covered Anaerobic Lagoons:** These lagoons are engineered to capture methane emissions that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.\n- **Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment Systems:** These systems will treat wastewater while simultaneously recovering biogas.\n- **Biogas Utilization:** The captured biogas will be combusted or destroyed and used as a thermal energy source to replace fossil fuels such as coal.\n- **Monitoring Systems:** Comprehensive monitoring will be conducted to ensure adherence to local environmental regulations and standards.\n\nThe project is located in Cu Pui Commune, Krong Bong District, Dak Lak Province, Vietnam, specifically at Bu\u00f4n Kh\u00f3a, X\u00e3 C\u01b0 Pui, Huy\u1ec7n Kr\u00f4ng B\u00f4ng, T\u1ec9nh \u0110\u1eafk L\u1eafk, Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nThis project aims to generate significant GHG emission reductions through the following mechanisms:\n\n- **Methane Capture and Combustion:** By installing covered biogas lagoons, methane emissions from wastewater treatment will be captured and either flared or used as an energy source.\n- **Replacement of Fossil Fuels:** The biogas recovered will replace coal used in the factory for drying starch, further reducing GHG emissions.\n\nPrior to the implementation of this project, wastewater was treated in six open anaerobic lagoons without any methane recovery, leading to substantial methane emissions. Methane is a major component of biogas produced during anaerobic treatment. Additionally, CO2 emissions from the decomposition of organic waste were not accounted for, and N2O emissions were excluded for simplification.\n\nThe project is estimated to achieve an average annual reduction of 32,735 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). Over the 7-year crediting period, the total GHG emission reductions are projected to be 229,141 tCO2e.\n\nThis comprehensive summary elucidates the nature, implementation, and anticipated environmental impact of the project, providing a clear understanding of its contribution to GHG emission reductions."

        "section_name": "Conditions Prior to Project Initiation",
        "generation": "## Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\n\n### Overview\nPrior to the initiation of the project, the wastewater treatment system relied on six open anaerobic lagoons. These lagoons treated wastewater before discharging it into the river. The anaerobic process, operating in the absence of oxygen, produced biogas with methane (CH4) as a significant component. Crucially, there was no mechanism for methane recovery, allowing this potent greenhouse gas to escape into the atmosphere.\n\n### Environmental Context\nWhile effective in treating wastewater, the open anaerobic lagoons posed a substantial environmental challenge due to the uncontrolled release of methane. Methane is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a global warming potential far exceeding that of carbon dioxide (CO2). The absence of methane capture and combustion infrastructure meant that the lagoons were a continuous source of methane emissions, exacerbating atmospheric GHG levels.\n\n### Project Purpose and Implementation\nThe primary aim of the project was to tackle the uncontrolled release of methane by implementing a system capable of capturing and destroying this greenhouse gas. Key activities included:\n- Installing new biogas lagoons with covers to prevent methane escape.\n- Capturing and combusting methane, thereby converting it into less harmful byproducts.\n- Enhancing the anaerobic wastewater treatment system with integrated biogas recovery.\n\nBy capturing and combusting methane, the project sought to significantly reduce GHG emissions. This initiative falls under the waste handling and disposal projects category as defined by the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).\n\n### Baseline Scenario\nThe baseline scenario mirrors the conditions existing prior to project initiation. Thus, the description of pre-project conditions fully represents the baseline scenario. For further details, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the conditions prior to project initiation were marked by the presence of open anaerobic lagoons that significantly contributed to methane emissions. The project's objective was not to generate GHG emissions but to mitigate them through the introduction of biogas recovery and combustion technologies. This proactive approach aligns with the goals of reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainable waste management practices."

Each condition is meticulously addressed to ensure thorough compliance.\\n\\n#### Methodology ID: VM0007\\n\\n**Applicability Condition 1:**\\n\\n- **Condition:** This methodology is applicable if the baseline system is an anaerobic lagoon characterized by ponds with a depth exceeding two meters, devoid of aeration. The depth should be ascertained from engineering design documents, direct measurements, or by dividing the surface area by the total volume. For lagoons with seasonal variations in filling levels, the average of the highest and lowest levels may be used.\\n\\n- **Justification of Compliance:** The project satisfies this condition by integrating a capacity addition to the existing wastewater treatment system. The anaerobic lagoon in question has been verified to have a depth greater than two meters, as corroborated by engineering design documents and direct measurements. Additionally, the project addresses significant technical barriers through the collaboration and expertise of AES Engineering LLC and Agasco Limited, ensuring the lagoon's characteristics are consistent with the methodology's requirements.\\n\\n**Applicability Condition 2:**\\n\\n- **Condition:** This methodology is applicable if the ambient temperature exceeds 15\u00b0C, at least for part of the year, on a monthly average basis.\\n\\n- **Justification of Compliance:** The project adheres to this condition by incorporating a sequential stage of wastewater treatment that includes biogas recovery and combustion, supplanting an anaerobic wastewater treatment system without biogas recovery.

In this context, the baseline scenario is identified as the continued use of open anaerobic lagoons for wastewater treatment, both for the existing and increased factory capacity, without a methane recovery system. This section outlines the steps taken to identify and justify this baseline scenario, following the procedure set out in the applied methodology and relevant tools.\n\n### Steps Involved in the Applied Methodology\n\n#### Step 1: Identification of Alternatives\nThe first step involves identifying various alternatives that could provide comparable levels of service to the proposed project activity. These alternatives include:\n- Continued use of open anaerobic lagoons without methane recovery (current practice).\n- Upgrading to covered anaerobic lagoons with methane recovery.\n- Installation of an advanced aerobic treatment system.\n- Implementation of a combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment system.\n\n#### Step 2: Compliance with Local Regulations\nIn this step, we evaluate the identified alternatives for compliance with local environmental and wastewater treatment regulations. The alternatives that do not meet these regulatory requirements are excluded from further consideration. The analysis concluded that all identified alternatives are compliant with local regulations.\n\n#### Step 3: Barrier Analysis and Ranking of Alternatives\nThis step involves applying barrier tests to eliminate and rank the alternatives. The tests include:\n- **Investment Barriers**: Assessing the financial feasibility and attractiveness of each alternative.\n- **Technological Barriers**: Evaluating the availability of technology and expertise required for implementation.\n- **Other Barriers**: Considering factors such as infrastructure limitations and market conditions.\n\nBased on these tests, the alternatives were ranked as follows:\n1.

Installation of an advanced aerobic treatment system.\n4. Implementation of a combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment system.\n\n#### Step 4: Eligibility and Selection of Baseline Scenario\nThe final step ensures that the project activity is eligible under the methodology if only one alternative remains that meets specific criteria. The continued use of open anaerobic lagoons without methane recovery emerges as the only viable alternative that:\n- Is not the proposed project activity without being registered as a CDM project activity.\n- Corresponds to one of the baseline scenarios provided in the methodology.\n\n### Key Assumptions, Rationale, and Methodological Choices\n\n#### Key Assumptions\n- **Sample Size for COD Measurements**: Ensures a 90/10 confidence/precision level, assuming continuous and independent wastewater flow.\n- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**: Used as the investment benchmark, calculated using default debt and equity ratios, and default values for expected return on equity.\n- **Investment Analysis Duration**: Conducted for at least 10 years, including the fair value of project assets and excluding corporation tax for simplicity.\n- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Considers \u00b110% variations in key parameters such as investment cost, operational cost, and cost of coal to assess the impact on project Internal Rate of Return (IRR).\n\n#### Rationale Behind Methodological Choices\n- **Use of Default Values and Methodologies**: The AMS-III.H v.19 and IPCC default values are applied to ensure consistency and reliability.\n- **Demonstration of Additionality**: Addressing investment and technological barriers using the Methodological tool for demonstrating additionality.\n- **Sampling and Measurement Methods**: Ensuring accuracy and reliability through specific methods to monitor Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) levels.\n- **Compliance with Standards**: Aligning with established standards to overcome significant financial and technical barriers.\n\n#### Methodological Choices\n1. **Additionality Demonstration**: Through investment and technological barriers, including high costs and less common technology.\n2. **AMS-III.H Methodology**: Meeting all additionality and baseline requirements.\n3. **Investment Analysis**: Using WACC as the benchmark, covering 15 years of operation.\n4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Demonstrating financial unattractiveness without carbon revenue.\n5. **Technological Barriers**: Addressing lack of human capacity and infrastructure for new technology.\n6. **Sampling and Measurement**: Ensuring a 90/10 confidence/precision level for monitoring COD levels.\n7. **Compliance and Ranking**: Ensuring alternatives comply with local regulations and ranking them based on barrier tests.\n\n### Relevant References\n- AMS-III.H v 19\n- FCCC/SBSTA/2003/10/Add.2\n- IPCC Default Values\n- TOOL 05: Baseline, Project, and/or Leakage Emissions from Electricity Consumption and Monitoring of Electricity Generation V.3\n- TOOL 06: Project Emissions from Flaring V.4\n- TOOL 21: Demonstration of Additionality of Small-Scale Project Activities\n- Tool to Calculate the Emission Factor for an Electricity System (Published January 3, 2022)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe baseline scenario has been identified and justified as the continued use of open anaerobic lagoons without a methane recovery system. This scenario was determined through a systematic application of the methodology, considering various alternatives, compliance with regulations, and overcoming significant barriers. The methodological choices and key assumptions have been thoroughly explained and referenced to ensure a comprehensive and professional approach."

These primary components encompass emissions from wastewater treatment systems and emissions from degradable organic carbon in treated wastewater discharge. The subsequent sections delineate the detailed procedure, pertinent equations, and methodological decisions for quantifying baseline emissions.\n\n#### General Equation for Baseline Emissions\n\nBaseline emissions (BEy) are quantified using the following general equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEy} = \\text{BEww,treatment,y} + \\text{BEww,discharge,y} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\text{BEww,treatment,y}\\) denotes the baseline emissions from wastewater treatment systems.\n- \\(\\text{BEww,discharge,y}\\) signifies the baseline methane emissions from degradable organic carbon in treated wastewater discharge.\n\n#### Detailed Equations and Parameters\n\n1. **Baseline Emissions from Wastewater Treatment Systems (BEww,treatment,y):**\n\n   \\[ \\text{BEww,treatment,y} = \\sum (\\text{Qww,i,y} \\times \\text{CODinflow,i,y} \\times \\eta_{\\text{COD,BL,i}} \\times \\text{MCFww,treatment,BL,i}) \\times \\text{Bo,ww} \\times \\text{UFB} \\times \\text{GWPCH4} \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\(\\text{Qww,i,y}\\): Quantity of wastewater treated in system \\(i\\) during year \\(y\\).\n   - \\(\\text{CODinflow,i,y}\\): Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the inflow to system \\(i\\) during year \\(y\\).\n   - \\(\\eta_{\\text{COD,BL,i}}\\): COD removal efficiency of the baseline treatment system \\(i\\).\n   - \\(\\text{MCFww,treatment,BL,i}\\): Methane Correction Factor for the baseline treatment system \\(i\\).\n   - \\(\\text{Bo,ww}\\): Methane-producing capacity of the wastewater.\n   - \\(\\text{UFB}\\): Fraction of methane in biogas.\n   - \\(\\text{GWPCH4}\\): Global Warming Potential of methane.\n\n2. **Baseline Emissions from Degradable Organic Carbon in Treated Wastewater Discharged (BEww,discharge,y):**\n\n   \\[ \\text{BEww,discharge,y} = \\text{Qww,y} \\times \\text{GWPCH4} \\times \\text{Bo,ww} \\times \\text{UFB} \\times \\text{CODww,discharge,BL,y} \\times \\text{MCFww,BL,discharge} \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\(\\text{Qww,y}\\): Quantity of treated wastewater discharged during year \\(y\\).\n   - \\(\\text{CODww,discharge,BL,y}\\): COD of the discharged wastewater in the baseline scenario during year \\(y\\).\n   - \\(\\text{MCFww,BL,discharge}\\): Methane Correction Factor for the discharge of treated wastewater in the baseline scenario.\n\n### Procedure for Quantification of Carbon Stock Changes\n\nWhile the methodology does not explicitly detail the quantification of carbon stock changes, it is crucial to monitor and account for any increases in carbon stock (sinks) that exceed baseline emissions, potentially resulting in negative baseline emissions. This involves tracking changes in biomass, soil organic carbon, and other relevant carbon pools over time.\n\n### Procedures and Equations for Reductions and Removals\n\nThe applied methodology does not specify distinct procedures and equations to separately identify reductions and removals. Instead, the focus is on calculating the overall baseline emissions and comparing them with project emissions to determine net reductions.\n\n### Methodological Choices and Justifications\n\n#### Selection of Emission Factors and Default Values\n\n- **IPCC Default Values:** Employing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default values ensures standardized and internationally recognized benchmarks for emission factors.\n- **Specific Methodologies:** Utilizing methodologies such as AMS-III.H v.19 provides a structured and validated approach for emission calculations.\n- **Default Values:** Default values, such as a 20% methane correction factor, are selected based on methodological tools to maintain consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nAll calculations for emission reductions and removals should be meticulously documented in an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This spreadsheet must include detailed inputs, intermediate steps, and final results to allow for transparent and reproducible calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the procedure for quantifying baseline emissions involves a series of well-defined equations and parameters that account for various sources of emissions. Methodological choices are justified to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the calculations. All relevant calculations should be thoroughly documented to facilitate verification and reproduction of the results."

        "generation": "## Leakage Emissions Quantification Procedure\n\n### 1. Introduction\nQuantifying leakage emissions is essential for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of emission reduction projects. This section details the procedure for quantifying leakage emissions in line with the applied methodology, specifically referencing the guidelines from paragraph 18 of the appendix of 'AMS-III.H.: Methane recovery in wastewater treatment'. The provided procedures and equations ensure clarity and precision in reproducing the calculations.\n\n### 2. Procedure for Quantification of Leakage Emissions\nLeakage emissions primarily stem from two sources:\n1. **Physical Leakage during Storage and Transportation of Upgraded Biogas:** This includes any fugitive emissions occurring during biogas storage or transportation.\n2. **Emissions from Fossil Fuel Consumption by Transport Vehicles:** This encompasses emissions from fossil fuels used by vehicles transporting biogas.\n\n### 3. Specification of Reductions and Removals\nEmission reductions and removals are specified separately by calculating the emission reductions achieved annually. This calculation is based on the lowest value of biogas recovered and fuelled or flared (monitored ex post) and the ex post calculated baseline, project, and leakage emissions based on actual monitored data. The formula for emission reductions (ERy,ex,post) is derived from the minimum of these monitored values.\n\n### 4. Relevant Equations for Quantification\n#### 4.1 Fugitive Emissions\nFugitive emissions from wastewater treatment systems are calculated using the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{PEfugitive,ww,y} = (1 - \\text{CEFww}) \\times \\text{MEPww,treatment,y} \\times \\text{GWPCH4}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- **CEFww:** Capture efficiency of biogas recovery equipment (default value of 0.9)\n- **MEPww,treatment,y:** Methane emission potential of wastewater treatment systems\n- **GWPCH4:** Global Warming Potential of methane\n\n#### 4.2 Project Emissions from Flaring\nProject emissions from flaring are calculated using the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Fi,t} = \\text{FCH4,m} = \\text{FCH4,RGm}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- **FCH4,RGm:** Mass flow of methane in the residual gas\n- **Vm,db:** Volumetric flow of the gaseous stream on a dry basis\n- **Vt,db:** Volumetric flow of the gaseous stream on a dry basis\n- **\u03c1i,t:** Density of greenhouse gas i in the gaseous stream\n- **\u03c1i,t:** \\( \\text{Pt} \\times \\frac{\\text{MMi}}{\\text{Ru} \\times \\text{Tt}} \\)\n- **Pt:** Pressure at time t\n- **MMi:** Molar mass of gas i\n- **Ru:** Universal gas constant\n- **Tt:** Temperature at time t\n\n### 5. Information Needed to Reproduce Calculations\nTo accurately reproduce the calculations, the following data and parameters are required:\n- Quantity of electricity consumed by the project electricity consumption source (ECPJ,i,y)\n- Emission factor for electricity generation (EFj,y)\n- Average technical transmission and distribution losses (TDLj,y)\n- Chemical oxygen demand of treated wastewater (CODww,discharge,PJ,y)\n- Methane correction factor based on the discharge pathway (MCFww,PJ,discharge)\n- Data on physical leakage during storage and transportation of upgraded biogas\n- Emissions data from fossil fuel consumption by vehicles transporting biogas\n\n### 6. Methodological Choices and Justifications\n#### 6.1 Physical Leakage during Storage and Transportation\nThe choice of default values for physical leakage during storage and transportation of upgraded biogas is based on the methodology AMS-III.H v.19 and IPCC default values. These choices ensure consistency and reliability in the estimation of emissions.\n\n#### 6.2 Emissions from Fossil Fuel Consumption\nThe emissions from fossil fuel consumption by transport vehicles are quantified using standard emission factors. The selection of these factors is justified by their acceptance in international guidelines and their ability to accurately reflect real-world conditions.\n\n### 7. Emission Reduction and Removal Calculation Spreadsheet\nAll calculations for baseline emissions, project emissions, leakage, and net GHG emission reductions and removals are included in the emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet. This ensures transparency and allows for easy verification and replication of the results.\n\n### 8. Conclusion\nThis comprehensive procedure for quantifying leakage emissions ensures that all relevant factors are considered and provides accurate, reproducible calculations. By adhering to the outlined methodology and justifying all choices, the integrity of the emission reduction project is maintained, and the results are reliable and verifiable."
