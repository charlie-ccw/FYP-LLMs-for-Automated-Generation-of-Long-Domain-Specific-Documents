This will involve:\n- Identifying the root cause of the non-conformance.\n- Implementing corrective actions to address the issue.\n- Documenting the process for future reference and improvement.\n\n**Sampling Approaches and QA/QC Procedures:**\n\nSampling approaches will be designed to ensure the reliability and representativeness of the monitored data. This will include:\n- Target precision levels to minimize errors.\n- Defined sample sizes based on statistical analysis.\n- Strategic sample site locations to capture variations.\n- Regular QA/QC procedures to validate data integrity.\n\n**GHG Data Collection and Management System:**\n\nA line diagram illustrating the GHG data collection and management system will be developed to visually represent the flow of data from monitoring to analysis and reporting. This diagram will provide a clear overview of the data management process for stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the effective management of monitored data and parameters is essential for the successful operation of the Wangxingzhuang CMM Power Generation Project. By implementing robust procedures and utilizing advanced technology, the project aims to achieve accurate monitoring, analysis, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions data."
